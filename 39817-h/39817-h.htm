<h2 class="gap4"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The plan of a general history of English literature in a
series of introductory manuals, each dealing with a well-defined
period and individually complete, as set forth in
the preface to Mr. Dennis&#8217;s <i>Age of Pope</i>, is advanced a
stage further by the present volume.</p>

<p>The period described, from its chief literary figure, as
<i>The Age of Dryden</i>, and which might with equal propriety
have been entitled <i>The Age of the Restoration</i>,
extends from 1660 to 1700. Some very important writers,
such as Milton and Clarendon, the composition or publication
of whose principal works falls within this epoch, have
been passed over as belonging in style and spirit to the preceding
age; and in a few instances this procedure has been
reversed. In the main, however, the last forty years of the
seventeenth century constitute the period of literary
activity represented, and will be found to be demarcated
with unusual precision from both the preceding and the
ensuing era.</p>

<p>The writer of a literary history embracing works on a
great variety of topics will soon discover that he is expected
to impart more information than he possesses. If in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
measure endowed with the grace of modesty, he will
frequently feel compelled to acknowledge with Mr. Edward
Gibbon Wakefield, when, after having overcome every other
difficulty in the foundation of his colony, he came to provide
it with a bishop: &#8216;I fear I do not very well understand
this part of the subject myself.&#8217; Trusty guides,
however, fortunately are not wanting. The author&#8217;s
warmest acknowledgments are due for the assistance he
has derived from personal communication with Professor
Hales, and from the writings of Macaulay, Matthew
Arnold, Mr. Gosse, Professor Saintsbury, Mr. Churton
Collins, and Dr. Fowler. He is indebted for the Index
to Mr. J. P. Anderson, of the Reading Room of the
British Museum.</p>

<p class="xlarge center gap4"><b>THE AGE OF DRYDEN.</b></p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>The accession of Charles II. as king <i>de facto</i>, which in
the political history of England marks a Restoration, in
her literary history marks a Revolution. Not that the
transition from one mode of writing and thinking to
another was instantaneous, or enjoined by legislative or
academical decree. It had long been slowly progressing,
and its unequivocal triumph would probably have come to
pass sooner but for the obstruction to the intellectual life
of the nation occasioned by twenty years of civil commotion.
The magnitude of this impediment appears from
the fact that all the writings of even so great a scholar and
poet as Milton, produced during this interval, were of a
polemical nature. When at last society found sufficient
stability to allow its members to write for fame, emolument,
or the extension of knowledge, it quickly became
manifest how wide a gulf yawned between the men of
that day and the men of twenty years ago. The new
influence, indeed, had long been at work. A comparison,
for example, of the last of the old dramatists, Massinger
and Shirley, with their predecessors, evinces how much
even in their day the stage was losing in poetry, in
imagination, and in the charm of musical metre; how
rapidly its personages were degenerating from vital indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>vidualities
into conventional types; how much, on the other
hand, always excepting Shakespeare&#8217;s pieces from the
comparison, it was gaining in logic and construction. An
examination of other forms of literature would reveal a
similar clarifying process, a steady discouragement of the
quaint affectation which was the bane of Elizabethan
literature, combined, unfortunately, with increasing sterility
of fancy, and growing insensibility to the noble harmonies
of which English prose is capable. An Elizabethan poet,
indeed, Samuel Daniel, had in some of his works almost
anticipated the style of the eighteenth century; in general,
however, writers during the period of the Civil War seem
to our apprehension more or less encrusted with the
mellow patina of antiquity, conspicuously absent from
nearly everyone who wrote under Charles II. Hence the
accession of this monarch, in whose person the new taste
might be said to be enthroned, is justly regarded as the
commencement of the new era. Charles&#8217;s personal influence
on letters was not insignificant. &#8216;The king,&#8217; says a
contemporary, Burnet, &#8216;had little or no literature, but
true and good sense, and had got a right notion of style,
for he was in France at a time when they were much
set on reforming their language. It soon appeared that
he had a true taste. So this helped to raise the value of
these men [Tillotson and others], when the king approved
the style their discourses generally ran in, which
was clear, plain, and short.&#8217; Burnet, therefore, had no
doubt that correct principles of taste had been established
in England in Charles II.&#8217;s time, and partly by the king&#8217;s
instrumentality&mdash;a dictum equivalent to the condemnation
of all preceding English literature as barbarous. Such
was also the opinion of one of the masters of English style
in the succeeding century, David Hume.</p>

<p>Charles II. was not a man who could under any circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>stances
have sympathized greatly with the poetry of
Spenser, or the prose of Raleigh or Hooker. The native
bent of his mind was, moreover, strengthened by contingencies,
among which Burnet justly gives a foremost place
to his residence in France. It must be added that this
influence coincided with a movement which, if for the
time disadvantageous to English literature, was, nevertheless,
essential if it was to cease to be merely insular. Until
the time of Charles I. this literature, in so far as it
owed anything to external patterns of modern date, had
been chiefly dependent upon Italy. This might have
long continued but for the decay of Italian letters
consequent upon the triumph of foreign oppression and
spiritual despotism throughout the peninsula. France
stepped into the vacant place, and developed a literature
qualified to impress other nations no less by its defects
than by its virtues, by its want of elevation as well as
by its sprightliness and lucidity. Ere long French ideas
of style had pervaded Europe, and approximation to
French modes was the inevitable qualification for the great
mission of human enlightenment which was to devolve
upon Britain in the succeeding century. Up to this time
the literature of England had resembled that of Spain,
original and racy of the soil, grander and more noble than
the less dignified literature whose statutes it was to keep
and whose laws it was to observe for a season, but on this
very account comparatively out of touch with the common
needs of men. Had British writers continued to indite
the prose of Hooker and Milton, their ideas would have
found no entrance into the Continent; and grievous as was
the declension from the poetry and music of these great
writers to the <i>sermo pedestris</i> of their successors, this was
more than counterbalanced by the acquisition of lucidity,
logic, and cogency. The loss was but temporary, the gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
was everlasting; for the nineteenth century has found it
possible to restore much of the solemn pomp and musical
and pictorial charm of Elizabethan English, without parting
with the clearness and coherence which are indispensable
for a literature that would deeply affect the world.
In becoming for a moment French, English literature first
became European&mdash;happy that the new influence did not,
as elsewhere, penetrate too far, and that when all of good
that the foreigner could proffer had been assimilated,
speech and style regained their nationality. They did not,
however, thus revert to their old channel. &#8216;The Restoration,&#8217;
says Matthew Arnold with justice, &#8216;marks the real
moment of birth of our modern English prose.&#8217; This
prose, indeed, has since been vastly enriched by recurrence
to antique models, but gains from this source have always
been felt to partake of the nature of importation. The
vital point of Restoration practice is accepted by all who
do not deliberately aim at the composition of poems in
prose. &#8216;It is,&#8217; says Arnold, &#8216;by its organism&mdash;an organism
opposed to length and involvement, and enabling us to be
clear, plain, and short&mdash;that English style after the Restoration
breaks with the style of the times preceding it, finds
the true law of prose, and becomes modern; becomes, in
spite of superficial differences, the style of our own day.&#8217;</p>

<p>This age of metamorphosis, therefore, is one of the most
important in the history of English literature, and if the
men of the Restoration could have beheld themselves in
their relation, not only to their predecessors, but also to
their successors, their complacency would not have been
unjustifiable. Their inability to apprehend their true relation
to either was a failing by no means peculiar to them,
but it has exposed them to a double measure of the ridicule
of posterity, who roar with laughter over Pepys&#8217;s dictum
that <i>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</i> &#8216;seems but a mean thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>&#8217;
after Sir Samuel Tuke&#8217;s <i>Adventures of Five Hours</i>, and
are hardly more merciful to Dryden&#8217;s conversion of <i>Paradise
Lost</i> into an opera. It must be owned that the
conception of poetry as something awful, spiritual, and
divine, became for a time extinct. Shelley&#8217;s Defence of
Poetry, could such a work have existed, would have seemed
even more absurd to that age than Mr. Pepys&#8217;s critical
deliverances do to ours. The excuse is that the particular
work assigned to the period was incompatible with a very
high standard of poetry. This work, as we have seen, was
the regeneration of English prose by the elimination of
those elements which unfitted it for clear precise reasoning
and practical business, and the making English a
tongue in which Bunyan and Cobbett might be classics
equally with Bacon and Sir Thomas Browne. Such an
achievement implies a prosaic age. If the latter part of
the seventeenth century could have produced Miltons, these
would have continued to write as Milton did: it was therefore
fortunate for the language in the long run that
supreme genius should have for the time died out, and
have been replaced by a vigorous, terrestrial, unideal genius
that, having no oracle, required no tripod. For a time, no
doubt, the contrast must have seemed very dismal to any
who yet retained a perception of the richness and glory of
the Elizabethan epoch. But we, if we compare, not to
say the letters of Cromwell, but those of Charles I., with
the despatches of Wellington, cannot but be sensible of an
enormous advance, not merely in the effectiveness of speech,
but in its dignity and simplicity, and of a great enrichment
of the language by the newly acquired power to deal with
common things. For this the men of the Restoration are
to be thanked: and it must be added that their work could
not have been done if they had not thoroughly believed in
it; and that this belief necessitated, except in such superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
minds as Dryden&#8217;s, contempt for their predecessors and a
genuine preference of their sorry foreign models to Shakespeare.
The revolution which they effected in matters of
taste may be compared to the contemporary revolution in
politics. The Restoration government was a sad decline
from the enthusiastic visions of Milton and Vane, or even
from the wise and sturdy sway of Cromwell. Nevertheless
the English nation accepted and maintained it as the best
arrangement which the circumstances of the time admitted.
So the new style in literature was universally accepted
because the old style was for a time effete; because tasks
had been imposed and needs had arisen to which it was
unable to respond; because, in short, a prosaic age craved
a prosaic literature. We look, therefore, on the Restoration
period as anything but an ideal epoch, but at the same
time as a most momentous one; as one to which we are
indebted for much of our present command over the
resources of our language; and to which Britain owes very
much of her present power over the world. Acquaintance
with its leading representatives also proves that, if less
picturesque figures than their predecessors, they were not
inferior in mental power. And, although the age is justly
regarded as in the main an age of prose; yet, as poets
respond most readily to the influences of their time, and
are usually in the van of intellectual revolutions, so the
leading figure in the literary history even of this epoch of
prose is a poet&mdash;Dryden, doubtless the most prosaic of all
our great poets, but inferior to none in intellectual force;
and one whose poverty and pliability made him the mirror
of the less worthy tendencies of his time on the one hand,
while his higher aspirations and the force of his genius
rendered him no less the representative of its better qualities
on the other. With Dryden, therefore, we commence
our survey.</p>

<span class="smaller">JOHN DRYDEN AS A POET.</span></h2>

<p>John Dryden was born August 9, 1631, at Aldwinkle All
Saints, between Thrapston and Oundle, in Northamptonshire.
He was the grandson of Sir Erasmus Dryden,
baronet, of Canons Ashby, in the same county; and his
father possessed a small landed property, which he transmitted
to the poet. Dryden maintained a connection with
his native county all his life, but it was never close; of the
rest of the world, outside London and Cambridge, he only
occasionally saw anything. Few of our great writers have
been so thoroughly identified with the metropolis, of which
he became an inhabitant at an early age by his entry at
Westminster School, the precise date of which is unknown.
Locke and South were among his schoolfellows. He must
have distinguished himself, having been elected to Cambridge
in 1650. Before leaving Westminster he had made
his first appearance as an author by the publication of a
copy of verses on the death from smallpox of his schoolfellow
Lord Hastings, an unintentional <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>
of the reigning fashion of extravagant conceits in the style
of Marino and Gongora. This composition, otherwise
worthless, foreshadows in a manner the whole of Dryden&#8217;s
career. He was not one of the writers who themselves
form the taste by which they are ultimately judged, but
rather one of those who achieve fame by doing best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
what all desire to be done; the representatives of their
age, not its reformers. Little is known of his career at
Cambridge except that he was on one occasion &#8216;discommoned
and gated&#8217; for some irregularity, that he took his
degree in 1654, and, though obtaining no fellowship, continued
to reside until about 1657, when he removed to
London, with what precise plans or expectations is uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The general knowledge displayed in his critical
writings (he scarcely ever, says Johnson, appears to want
book-learning but when he mentions books) justifies the
conclusion that his time had been employed in study:
how greatly his mind had matured was attested by his
verses on the death of Cromwell (1658), which, if disfigured
by some conceits, exhibit a more sustained elevation
than any contemporary except Milton or Marvell could have
attained. They were rivalled by his congratulatory verses
on the Restoration (1660), which naturally exposed him to
the reproach of inconsistency, but, as Johnson remarks, &#8216;If
he changed, he changed with the nation.&#8217; There can,
indeed, be no doubt that the establishment of a settled
government was approved by the good sense as well as by
the loyalty of the country, and although circumstances
were to make Dryden the most formidable of political controversialists
upon paper, his temperament was not that of
a polemic, and, save when he had committed himself too far
to retreat, he was always ready to acquiesce in what commended
itself to the general sentiment of his countrymen.
The Restoration was also a joyful event to men of letters,
if for no other reason than that it re-opened the stage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>which, while as yet the periodical press was not, afforded
the best market and the readiest opportunity for literary
talent. Dryden is said to have had a play ready soon
after the Restoration, and it is difficult to understand,
except from a certain inertness in his constitution, ever
most readily responsive to the spur of necessity, why he
should have so long delayed his appearance as a dramatist.
The determining motive may ultimately have been his
marriage (not, apparently, a very fortunate one) to Lady
Elizabeth Howard, eldest daughter of the Earl of Berkshire,
in December, 1663; for in that year he produced his first
play, <i>The Wild Gallant</i>, and from that time we find him,
for many years, sedulously at work to earn money by a
description of literary activity notoriously uncongenial to
him. Only one of his numerous plays, he tells us, was
written to please himself. The long list includes, <i>The
Indian Emperor</i> (1665), in which, instead of reforming
the weak blank verse of his day, which would have been a
most important service, he fell in with the prevalent fashion
of rhymed tragedy; <i>Tyrannic Love</i> (1669), and <i>The Conquest
of Granada</i> (1672), in which he carries rhymed
bombast as far as it would go, but at the same time displays
surprising energy and vigour; <i>Aurengzebe</i> (1675),
also a rhyming play, but a great improvement; <i>All for Love</i>
(1678), and <i>Don Sebastian</i> (1690), examples of a purer
taste; and <i>The Spanish Friar</i> (1683), and <i>Amphitryon</i>
(1690), his best comedies. These pieces, the chief landmarks
of his dramatic career, will be subsequently considered.</p>

<p>Returning to the incidents of Dryden&#8217;s life, we find
little to chronicle for several years except the births of
three children, his elevation to the laureateship in 1670,
and various literary controversies of no interest at this
day except as they served to call forth the admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
critical prefaces by which he did more for English prose
style than his poetry was at that time effecting for English
verse. It is remarkable how late his genius flowered, and
how long he was in discovering his proper path. He might
never have found it at all but for the accidental coincidence
of the political controversies of his time with his official
position as poet laureate. This seemed to impose on
Dryden the duty of coming to the assistance of the Court,
and his recognition of the obligation produced (1681)
<i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, which at once gave him the distinction
of the greatest satirist our literature had yet
produced, the most consummate artist in the heroic
couplet, and the most cogent reasoner in rhyme. <i>The
Medal</i>, occasioned by a medal struck by the City in honour
of the failure of the indictment of Shaftesbury, was suggested
as the subject of a poem by Charles II. The fact
has been doubted, and does not rest upon very strong
external authority, but is confirmed by a letter from
Dryden to the Treasurer, Hyde, now in the British Museum,
shown by internal evidence to have been written after the
publication of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, and consequently
after the striking of the medal on occasion of Shaftesbury&#8217;s
acquittal. In this, after speaking of his expense in the
education of his children, complaining of the irregular
receipt of his pension, and remarking that even a quarter
in advance &#8216;is but the Jesuits&#8217; powder to my disease, the
fit will return a fortnight hence,&#8217; he adds, &#8216;I am going to
write somewhat by his Majesty&#8217;s command, and cannot
stir into the country for my health and studies till I secure
my family from want.&#8217; This can hardly have been anything
but <i>The Medal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The appeal, after some delay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>brought Dryden an addition to his pension and a sinecure
office in the Customs.</p>

<p>This was the most active period of Dryden&#8217;s life as a poet.
A personal altercation occasioned by an attack on <i>The Medal</i>
by Thomas Shadwell produced <i>MacFlecknoe</i>, the bitterest
of his satires, and in the same year of 1682 appeared the
second part of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, chiefly by Nahum
Tate, but containing upwards of two hundred lines from
Dryden&#8217;s own pen, dealing with his literary antagonists in
a style of sovereign mastery. Almost simultaneously
appeared <i>Religio Laici</i>, &#8216;a serious argument in verse on
the credibility of the Christian religion and the merits of
the Anglican form of doctrine and church government.&#8217;
Dryden&#8217;s mastery over metrical ratiocination made the
subject attractive; but the Church of England had hardly
done rejoicing in her champion when she was scandalized
by his exodus to the Church of Rome. It is not likely
that he was altogether insincere; but it can hardly be
doubted that the death of a monarch of taste and parts,
who valued him for his genius, and the accession of a successor
who valued men only for their theology, and gently hinted
the fact by docking his salary of a hundred pounds, had
more to do with his resolution than he quite acknowledged
to himself. The position of the Protestant laureate of a
Popish sovereign called upon to bid Protestants rejoice
over the birth of a Popish Prince of Wales, generally in
that age believed to have been smuggled into the palace
in a warming-pan, would assuredly have presented difficulties
even to those who found none in extolling George II.&#8217;s
patronage of the arts. Dryden was too deeply committed
to expect anything from the other side. The apology for
his conversion was given to the world in his <i>Hind and
Panther</i> (1687), a poem displaying even augmented power
of reasoning in rhyme, and which might have ranked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
his best but for the absurdity of the machinery. Soon
afterwards the unsoundness of the foundation on which he
had built his fortunes was demonstrated by the Revolution,
which deprived him of the laureateship and swept
away all official sources of income. But for his change
of religion he might have taken the oaths to the new
government without censure, but he had broken down the
bridges behind him, and seemed for a moment to have
left himself no alternative between want and infamy. A
third nevertheless remained, hard labour for the booksellers.
To his great honour, Dryden grappled with the
situation with all the sturdy tenacity of his lymphatic
temperament, and in the same spirit which Scott afterwards
displayed under similar circumstances. He may
probably have reformed his system of living, which can
hardly have been other than extravagant; certain it is
that if he could not keep entirely out of debt, he at least
kept out of disgrace, and that the years which followed
his apparent ruin, if not the most brilliant part of his
life, were the most honourable and honoured. It should
be added that he appears to have been largely assisted by
the generosity of friends, especially Dorset.</p>

<p>The work which Dryden now found to do, for which he
possessed extraordinary qualifications, and for which there
was a genuine demand in the age, was that of translation
from the Latin classics. The derivative character of Latin
literature was not then recognized, and Roman authors
received the veneration due of right only to the greatest
of the Greeks. No one doubted that they gave unsurpassable
models of style in their respective branches, and
not many among Dryden&#8217;s contemporaries questioned that
he had given a definite and durable form to English
poetry. In 1667, a few days before the publication of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, Pepys had overheard men saying that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
would never be such another English poet as Cowley, and
Dryden now stood in Cowley&#8217;s place. It seemed then a
highly desirable thing to bring these two classics together,
and Dryden was perfectly competent to do whatever was
expected of him. He would hardly have succeeded so well
with the Greek writers, even had his knowledge of the
language been more extensive; but he was well qualified
to reproduce the more distinctive qualities of Roman
poetry, its dignity, sometimes rising into majesty, its
manly sense, its vehemence, pregnancy, and terseness. By
1693 he had rendered all Persius, much of Juvenal (the
remainder was supplied by his sons), considerable portions
of Ovid, the first book of Homer, and something from
Theocritus, Horace, and Lucretius. In this year he commenced
a more ambitious work, a complete version of
Virgil. Of the merits of these works we shall speak hereafter;
it is sufficient to observe here that they for a long
time prescribed the laws of metrical translation in English.
It is pleasant to notice how many of them were executed
at the country seats of friends, where the old man, discharged
from the strife of faction and the noise and glare
of theatres, relieved his intellectual toil by the simple
amusements of a country life. Virgil was published in
1697, and remained, in the judgment of the age, at the
head of all English translations until Pope&#8217;s <i>Homer</i> came
to dethrone it. It was immediately succeeded by a greater
work still, his <i>Fables</i> from Chaucer and Boccaccio. Though
the representative of the literary taste of his time, Dryden
was by no means the representative of its prejudices. He
saw much more in Chaucer than his contemporaries were
capable of seeing, and, rightly judging that the antiquated
style of the old poet (who, however, appeared to him much
more uncouth than he really was) would effectually keep
him out of readers&#8217; hands, he determined to modernize and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
adapt some of his stories, to which narrative poems founded
on Boccaccio were afterwards added. The undertaking
precisely suited the genius of Dryden, which lay more in
expressing and adorning what he found ready to hand
than in original invention, and his <i>Fables</i>, published in
1699, are deservedly placed at the head of his works. It
is of course impossible that they should exhibit the same
intellectual strength as his argumentative and satirical
poems, but this is more than compensated by their superior
attractiveness, the additional scope offered for the display
of art, and their comparative freedom from everything
that can repel. The same volume contained his greatest
lyrical effort, the universally known <i>Alexander&#8217;s Feast</i>. He
received forty pounds for it; the Virgil is said to have
brought him twelve hundred; for the <i>Fables</i> he got only
three hundred. From a private letter of about this date
it appears that there was some idea of his receiving assistance
from the government, which he seems not unwilling
to accept, provided that it proves to require no sacrifice of
principle. It is not likely that he would have been allowed
to die in want; and indeed, early in 1700, a dramatic performance
was got up for his benefit. He died shortly
afterwards (May 1st, 1700) in narrow pecuniary circumstances,
but in the enjoyment of a more unquestioned
literary supremacy among his contemporaries than any
Englishman had held before him. The cause of his death
was the mortification of a toe inflamed by gout. He was
buried in Westminster Abbey. The funeral, for the splendour
of which Farquhar vouches in a contemporary letter,
is said to have been accompanied by tumultuary scenes,
but the absence of any reference to these in a malevolent
contemporary libel, ascribed to Thomas Brown, is sufficient
evidence that they did not occur.</p>

<p>There are few English writers of eminence whom it is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
difficult to realize satisfactorily to the mind&#8217;s eye as Dryden.
Personal enough in one respect, his writings are singularly
impersonal in another; he never paints, and seldom reveals
himself, and the aid which letters or reminiscences
might have afforded is almost entirely wanting. No one
noted his conversation; his enemies&#8217; attacks and his friends&#8217;
panegyrics are equally devoid of those traits of character
which might have invested a shadowy outline with life and
substance. The nearest approach to a portrait is Congreve&#8217;s,
which leaves most of the character in the shade,
and even this is somewhat suspicious, for Congreve was
Dryden&#8217;s debtor for noble praise, and the vindication of
Dryden&#8217;s repute had been imposed upon him by the poet
himself. The qualities, however, which he commends are
such as seem entirely reconcilable with the lymphatic temperament
which, partly on his own authority (&#8216;my conversation,&#8217;
he says, &#8216;is slow and dull, my humour saturnine
and reserved&#8217;), we have seen reason to attribute to Dryden.
We are told of his humanity and compassion, of his
readiness to forgive injuries, of a friendship that exceeded
his professions, of his diffidence in general society and
horror of intrusiveness, of his patience in accepting corrections
of his own errors, of which he must be allowed to
have given a remarkable instance in his submission to
Jeremy Collier. All these traits give the impression of
one who, though by no means pedantic, was only a wit
when he had the pen in his hand, and entirely correspond
with his apparent aversion to intellectual labour, except
under the pressure of want or the stimulus of Court favour.
When at length he did warm to his work, we know from
himself that thoughts crowded so rapidly upon him that
his only difficulty was to decide what to reject. Such a man
may well have appeared a negative character to his contemporaries,
and the events of his life were not of a nature to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
force his virtues or his failings into notice. We can only
say that there is no proof of his having been a bad husband;
that there is clear evidence of his having been a good
father; and that, although he took the wrong side in the
political and religious controversies of his day, this is no
reason why he may not, according to his light, have been a
good citizen. His references to illustrious predecessors
like Shakespeare and Milton, and promising young men
like Congreve, indicate a real generosity of character.
The moral defects of his writings, coarse licentiousness,
unmeasured invective, and equally unmeasured adulation,
belong to the age rather than to the man. On the whole,
we may say that he was one whom we should probably
have esteemed if we could have known him; but in whom,
apart from his writings, we should not have discovered
the first literary figure of his generation.</p>

<p>Dryden&#8217;s early poems, the <i>Heroic Stanzas</i> on the death
of Cromwell, the <i>Astraea Redux</i> on the Restoration, the
panegyric of Clarendon, and the verses on the Coronation,
are greatly marred for modern readers by extravagant conceits,
but are sobriety itself compared to the exploits of
contemporary poets, especially the Pindaric. In a more
important particular, Dryden, as Scott remarks, has observed
a singular and happy delicacy. The topic of the
Civil War is but slightly dwelt on; and, although Cromwell
is extolled, his eulogist abstains from any reflections
against those through whom he cut his way to greatness.
Isolated couplets in the other poems occasionally display
that perfection of condensed and pointed expression which
Dryden habitually attained in his later poems:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Spain to your gift alone her Indies owes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what the powerful takes not, he bestows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And France, that did an exile&#8217;s presence fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May justly apprehend you still too near.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Astraea Redux.</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></div></div></div>

<p>These early attempts, however, were completely thrown
into the shade by the <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>, a poem on the memorable
events of 1666, written at Charlton, near Malmesbury,
the seat of Lord Berkeley, where Dryden and his
family had resorted in 1665 to escape the plague, and published
in February, 1667. The author was then thirty-five,
and, judged in the light of his subsequent celebrity,
had as yet achieved surprisingly little either in quantity or
quality. Youth is generally the most affluent season of
poetical activity; and those poets whose claim to inspiration
is the most unimpeachable&mdash;Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth,
Shelley&mdash;have irradiated their early writings with
flashes of genius which their maturer skill hardly enabled
them to eclipse. This cannot be said of Dryden, who
of our great poets, unless Pope be an exception, probably
owed least to inspiration and most to pains and
practice. Even Pope at this age had produced <i>The Rape
of the Lock</i>, <i>The Temple of Fame</i>, <i>Eloisa to Abelard</i>, and his
translation of the Iliad, enough to have given him a high
place among English poets. The <i>Annus Mirabilis</i> was the
first production of Dryden that could have insured him
remembrance with posterity, and even this is sadly disfigured
with conceits. After all, the poet finds only two
marvels of his wonderful year worthy of record&mdash;the
Dutch war, which had been going on for two years, and
which produced a much greater wonder in the year ensuing,
when the Dutch sailed up to Gravesend and burned
the English fleet; and the Great Fire of London. The
treatment of the former is very tedious and dragging; there
are many striking lines, but more conceits like the following,
descriptive of the English attack upon the Dutch
East Indiamen:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Amidst whole heaps of spices lights a ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now their odours armed against them fly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some preciously by shattered porcelain fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And some by aromatic splinters die.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The second part, treating of the Fire of London, is infinitely
better. Dryden exhibits one of the most certain
marks of a good writer, he rises with his subject. Yet
there is no lack of absurdities. The Deity extinguishes
the conflagration precisely in the manner in which Dryden
would have put out his own candle:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;An hollow crystal pyramid he takes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In firmamental waters dipt above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of it a broad extinguisher he makes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hoods the flames that to their quarry drove.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nothing in Dryden is more amazing than his inequality.
This stanza is succeeded by the following:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;The vanquished fires withdraw from every place,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or, full with feeding, sink into a sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each household genius shows again his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And from the hearths the little Lares creep.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Other quatrains are still better, as, for instance, this on the
burning of St. Paul&#8217;s:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;The daring flames peeped in, and saw from far<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The awful beauties of the sacred quire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But since it was profaned by civil war,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heaven thought it fit to have it purged by fire.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A thought so striking, that the reader does not pause to
reflect that the celestial sentence would have been equally
applicable to every cathedral in the country. Perhaps the
following stanzas compose the passage of most sustained
excellence. In them, as in the apostrophe to the Royal
Society, in an earlier part of the poem, Dryden appears
truly the <i>vates sacer</i>, and his poetry becomes prophecy:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>For several years after <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>, Dryden produced
but little poetry apart from his dramas. Fashion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Court encouragement, and the necessity of providing for
his family, had bound him to what was then the most conspicuous
and lucrative form of authorship. In one point
of view he committed a great error in addicting himself to
the drama. He was not naturally qualified to excel in it,
and could only obtain even a temporary success by condescending
to the prevalent faults of the contemporary stage,
its bombast and its indecency. The latter transgression
was eventually so handsomely confessed by himself that
but little need be said of it. Bombast is natural to two
classes of writers, the ardent and the phlegmatic, and
those whose emotions require the most working up are
frequently the worst offenders. Such was Dryden&#8217;s case,
and his natural proclivity was much enhanced by his adoption
of the new fashion of writing in rhyme, beloved at Court,
but affording every temptation and every facility for straining
after effect in the place of Nature. Mr. Saintsbury
justly reminds us that Dryden was not forsaking the blank
verse of Shakespeare and Fletcher, the secret of which
had long been lost; nevertheless, although, as we shall
see when we come to his critical writings, he pleaded very
ingeniously for rhyme in 1665, his adoption of it was
condemned by his maturer judgment and practice. It was,
however, fortunate in the long run; his rhyming plays,
of which we shall speak in another place, would not have
been great successes in any metre, while practice in their
composition, and the necessity of expressing the multitude
of diverse sentiments required by bustling scenes and
crowds of characters, gradually gave him that command
of the heroic couplet which bestows such strength and
brilliancy on his later writings. His &#8216;fourteen years of
dramatic practice,&#8217; as Mr. Saintsbury justly says, &#8216;acted
as a filtering reservoir for his poetical powers, so that the
stream, which, when it ran into them, was the turbid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
rubbish-laden current of <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>, flowed out as
impetuous, as strong, but clear and without base admixture,
in the splendid verse of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This great poem, published in November, 1681, at the
height of the contest over the Exclusion Bill and its consequences,
remains to this day the finest example of
political satire in English literature. The theme was
skilfully selected. James II. had not yet convinced the
most sceptical of the justice and wisdom of the Exclusion
Bill, and its advocates laboured under the serious disadvantage
of having no strong claimant for the succession if they
prevailed in setting the Duke of York aside. James&#8217;s son-in-law,
the Prince of Orange, would not, it is safe to say,
ever have been accepted by the nation as king if James&#8217;s
folly and tyranny had not, years afterwards, given him the
opportunity of presenting himself in the character of
Deliverer; and, failing him, there was no one but the
popular but unfortunately illegitimate Monmouth. The
character of Absalom seemed exactly made for this handsome
and foolish prince. The resemblance of his royal
father to David, except in matters akin to the affair of
Bathsheba, was not quite so obvious. Dryden might
almost have been suspected of satirizing his master when
he wrote:</p>

<p>The management of Absalom was a difficult matter.
With all his transgressions, the rebel Monmouth was still
beloved by his father, and Dryden could not have ventured
to treat him as his prototype is treated by Scripture. He
has extricated himself from the dilemma with abundant
dexterity, but at some expense to his poem. The catastrophe
required by poetical justice does not come to pass, and the
conclusion is tame. All such defects, however, are forgotten
in the splendour of the execution. The versification is the
finest in its style that English literature had yet seen, the
perfection of heroic verse. The sense is weighty and
massive, as befits such an organ of expression, and, whatever
may be thought of Dryden&#8217;s flatteries of individuals,
there is no reason to doubt the sincerity with which he
here expresses his political convictions. He unquestionably
belonged to that class of mankind who cannot discern
principles apart from persons, and his contempt for
abstractions is pointedly expressed in one of his ringing
couplets:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Thought they might ruin him they could create,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or melt him to that golden calf&mdash;a state.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is not a very high manifestation of the intellect in its
application to political questions, but it bespeaks the class
of persons who provide ballast for the vessel of the state
in tempestuous times; and, on the whole, <i>Absalom and
Achitophel</i> is a poem which the patriot as well as the
admirer of genius may read with complacency. The royal
side of the question could not be better put than in these
lines placed in the mouth of David:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Thus long have I, by native mercy sway&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wrongs dissembled, my revenge delay&#8217;d;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So willing to forgive the offending age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much the father did the king assuage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now so far my clemency they slight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The offenders question my forgiving right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one was made for many, they contend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But &#8217;tis to rule; for that&#8217;s a monarch&#8217;s end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They call my tenderness of blood, my fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though manly tempers can the longest bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet since they will divert my native course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis time to shew I am not good by force.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those heap&#8217;d affronts, that haughty subjects bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are burdens for a camel, not a king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kings are the public pillars of the state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born to sustain and prop the nation&#8217;s weight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If my young Sampson will pretend a call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shake the column, let him share the fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh, that he yet would repent and live!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How easy &#8217;tis for parents to forgive!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With how few tears a pardon might be won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From nature pleading for a darling son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor, pitied youth, by my paternal care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised up to all the height his frame could bear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had God ordain&#8217;d his fate for empire born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would have given his soul another turn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gull&#8217;d with a patriot&#8217;s name, whose modern sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is one that would by law supplant his prince;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people&#8217;s brave, the politician&#8217;s tool;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never was patriot yet, but was a fool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence comes it, that religion and the laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should more be Absolom&#8217;s than David&#8217;s cause?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His old instructor, ere he lost his place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was never thought endued with so much grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good heavens, how faction can a patriot paint!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My rebel ever proves my people&#8217;s saint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would they impose an heir upon the throne?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Sanhedrims be taught to give their own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A king&#8217;s at least a part of government;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mine as requisite as their consent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without my leave a future king to choose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infers a right the present to depose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True, they petition me to approve their choice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Esau&#8217;s hands suit ill with Jacob&#8217;s voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My pious subjects for my safety pray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to secure, they take my power away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From plots and treasons heaven preserve my years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And save me most from my petitioners!&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It will be observed that &#8216;the right the present to depose,&#8217;
is mentioned by Dryden as something manifestly preposterous,
and the derivation of it as a logical corollary from
the Exclusion Bill is assumed to be a sufficient <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> of the latter. In the view of the majority of
the nation, this was sound doctrine until the Revolution,
which reduced Dryden&#8217;s poem from the rank of a powerful
political manifesto to that of a brilliant exercise of fancy
and dialectic. As such, it will never cease to please and
to impress. The finest passages are, no doubt, those
descriptive of character, whether carefully studied portraits
or strokes against particular foibles imputed to the poet&#8217;s
adversaries, such as this mock apology for the parsimonious
kitchen of the Whig sheriff, Slingsby Bethel:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Such frugal virtue malice may accuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sure &#8217;twas necessary to the Jews:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For towns, once burnt, such magistrates require,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dare not tempt God&#8217;s providence by fire.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The elaborate and glowing characters of Achitophel
(Shaftesbury) and Zimri (Buckingham) it is needless to
transcribe, as they are universally known. It may be
remarked that the character of the turbulent and adventurous
Shaftesbury does not match very well with that of
the Ulyssean Achitophel of Scripture, but Dryden has
wisely drawn from what he had before his eyes.</p>

<p><i>The Medal</i>, which we have seen reason for attributing to
the suggestion of Charles II. himself, appeared in March,
1682. It is a bitter invective against Shaftesbury, its
theme the medal which his partisans had very naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
struck upon the occasion of his acquittal in the preceding
autumn. It is entirely in a serious vein, and wants the
grace and urbanity of some parts of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>,
but is no way inferior as a piece of strong, vehement
satire. Shaftesbury&#8217;s conduct as a minister, before
his breach with the Court, is thus described:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Behold him now exalted into trust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His counsel&#8217;s oft convenient, seldom just:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in the most sincere advice he gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a grudging still to be a knave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frauds he learned in his fanatic years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made him uneasy in his lawful gears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At best, as little honest as he could,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like white witches, mischievously good.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The second part of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> appeared in
November, 1682. It was mainly the work of Nahum Tate,
who imitated his master&#8217;s versification with success, but
has numerous touches from the pen of Dryden, who inserted
a long passage of unparalleled satire against his adversaries,
especially Settle and Shadwell:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Who by my means to all succeeding times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall live in spite of their own doggrel rhymes.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The character of Shadwell (Og) is well known, but it is
impossible to avoid quoting a portion of it:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;The midwife laid her hand on his thick skull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this prophetic blessing&mdash;&#8220;Be thou dull;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink, swear and roar; forbear no lewd delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit for thy bulk; do any thing but write.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art of lasting make, like thoughtless men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A strong nativity&mdash;but for the pen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eat opium, mingle arsenic in thy drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still thou mayst live, avoiding pen and ink.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see, I see, &#8217;tis counsel given in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For treason, botch&#8217;d in rhyme, will be thy bane;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rhyme is the rock on which thou art to wreck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis fatal to thy fame and to thy neck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should thy metre good King David blast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A psalm of his will surely be thy last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darest thou presume in verse to meet thy foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, whom the penny pamphlet foil&#8217;d in prose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doeg, whom God for mankind&#8217;s mirth has made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#8217;ertops thy talent in thy very trade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doeg, to thee, thy paintings are so coarse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A poet is, though he&#8217;s the poet&#8217;s horse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A double noose thou on thy neck dost pull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For writing treason, and for writing dull.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die for faction is a common evil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to be hang&#8217;d for nonsense is the devil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hadst thou the glories of thy king exprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy praises had been satire at the best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou in clumsy verse, unlickt, unpointed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast shamefully defiled the Lord&#8217;s anointed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not rake the dunghill of thy crimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who would read thy life that reads thy rhymes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of King David&#8217;s foes, be this the doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May all be like the young man Absolom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, for my foes, may this their blessing be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To talk like Doeg, and to write like thee!&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Only a month before the appearance of this annihilating
attack, Dryden had devoted an entire poem to Shadwell,
who had justly provoked him by a scandalous libel. The
title of <i>MacFlecknoe</i> is derived from an Irish priest and,
with the exception of some good lines pointed out by
Southey and Lamb, a bad poet, already satirized by
Marvell. It is a vigorous attack, but not equal to the
passage in <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, and chiefly memorable
inasmuch as the machinery evidently suggested that of
Pope&#8217;s <i>Dunciad</i>.</p>

<p>Dryden&#8217;s next poetical efforts, the dramatic excepted,
were of quite another kind. Simultaneously with the
second part of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> appeared <i>Religio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Laici</i>, an argument for the faith of the Church of England
as a <i>juste milieu</i> between Popery and Deism. In one
respect this takes the highest place among the works of
Dryden, for it is the most perfect example he has given of
that reasoning in rhyme of which he was so great a master.
There is not and could not be any originality in the
reasonings themselves, but Pope&#8217;s famous couplet was
never so finely illustrated, except by Pope himself:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;True wit is nature to advantage drest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What oft was thought, but ne&#8217;er so well exprest.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>At the same time the poetry hardly rises to the height
which the theme might have justified. There is little to
captivate or astonish, but perpetual admiration attends
upon the masterly conduct of the argument, and the ease
with which dry and difficult propositions melt and glide in
harmonious verse. The execution is singularly equable;
but perhaps hardly maintains the elevation of the fine
exordium:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>Dryden&#8217;s next important poem brought obloquy upon
him in his own day, and must be perused with mingled
feelings in this. Between 1682 and 1687, the date of the
publication of <i>The Hind and the Panther</i>, the laureate
of the Church of England had, as we have seen, become a
Roman Catholic, and most reasonably desired to justify
this step to the world. The Court also expected his pen
to be drawn in their service, and hence the double purpose
which runs through the poem, of vindicating his personal
change of conviction and of justifying the political
measures to which James had had recourse for establishing
the supremacy of his church. All this was perfectly
natural; the extraordinary thing is that so great a master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of ridicule should have been blind to the ludicrous character
of the machinery which he devised to carry out his
purpose. The comparison of the true church to the milk-white
hind, and of the corrupt church to the beautiful but
spotted panther, might have been employed with propriety
as an ornament or illustration of the poem, but the endeavour
to make it the groundwork of the entire piece is pregnant
with absurdity. Animals may very well be introduced
as actors in a fiction upon condition that they behave like
animals; and their faculties may even be expanded to suit
the author&#8217;s purpose so long as their exercise is confined
to visible and concrete things; but the notion of a pair of
quadrupeds discussing the sacraments, tradition, and the
infallibility of the Pope, is only fit for burlesque, and constitutes,
indeed, a running burlesque upon the poem.
Dryden probably took up the idea without sufficient consideration,
and when he had made some progress in his
work he may well have been too enamoured with the beautiful
but preposterous exordium to surrender it to common
sense. Perverse and fantastic as is the plan of his poem,
none of his works is richer in beauties of detail. &#8216;In none,&#8217;
says Macaulay, &#8216;can be found passages more pathetic and
magnificent, greater ductility and energy of language, or a
more pleasing and various music.&#8217; The power of reasoning
in rhyme is little inferior to that displayed in <i>Religio Laici</i>,
and the narrative character of the piece allows of a diversified
variety excluded by the simply didactic character of its
predecessor. The invective against Calvinists and Socinians,
typified by the wolf and the fox, is an average, and not beyond
an average, example of Dryden&#8217;s matchless force.
Near the end, it will be perceived, he suddenly bethinks
himself that, as the apologist of James&#8217;s ostensible policy,
it is his business to recommend not persecution but toleration,
and he caps his objurgation with a passage conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
in a widely different spirit, a severe though unintentional
reflection upon the practice of his own church:</p>

<span class="i0">The noble image of the Deity.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dryden produced yet one more poem in the interest of the
Court, his <i>Britannia Rediviva</i>, an official panegyric on the
birth of the Prince of Wales, June, 1688. Literature has
perhaps no more signal instance of adulation wasted and
prediction falsified. Many lines are spirited, but others
betray Dryden&#8217;s fatal insensibility to the ridiculous in his
own person:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;When humbly on the royal babe we gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The manly lines of a majestic face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give awful joy.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The raptures of the Byzantine courtiers over the imperial
infant Protus were nothing to this. Dryden did not want
eloquence or dignity to celebrate the hero if he could have
found him; it was his and our misfortune that when the
hero did at last come to the throne the poet had disqualified
himself from extolling him. The landing in Torbay and the
triumphal march to London; the victory at the Boyne and
the defence of Londonderry were transactions as worthy of
epical treatment as any history records; but the only man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
in England who could have treated them epically deemed
them rather matter for elegy; and to have indulged in elegy
he must have fled to France. Public events and political
and religious controversy were no longer for him: stripped
of his means and position he betook himself to translation
and playwriting as the readiest means of repairing his
shattered fortunes, and it was not until the mellow sunset
of his life that he turned to the compositions which,
of all he ever wrote, have given the most delight and the
least offence, his <i>Fables</i>. These, published at the beginning
of 1700, include five adaptations from Chaucer, and three
stories told after Boccaccio, as well as <i>Alexander&#8217;s Feast</i>,
and a few other pieces. It would not be too much to say
that this book achieved two things, either of which would
have immortalized a poet: it fixed the standard of narrative
poetry, except of the metrical romance or ballad
class, and also that of heroic versification. The latter,
indeed, was thought for a time to have been transcended
by Pope, but modern ears have tired of the balanced seesaw
of the Popian couplet, and crave the ease and variety
of Dryden, restored to literature in Leigh Hunt&#8217;s <i>Story of
Rimini</i>, and afterwards imitated by Keats in <i>Lamia</i>. The
freedom which so great a master allows himself in rhyming
should be a lesson to modern purists: final sounds so
slightly akin as <i>guard</i> and <i>prepared</i>, <i>placed</i> and <i>last</i>, are of
continual occurrence. In matters still more important
than versification Dryden is in general equally admirable.
He subjected himself to a severe test in competing with
Chaucer&mdash;severer than he knew, for Chaucer was not
yet, even by Dryden, valued at his full worth. In some
respects Dryden certainly suffers greatly by the comparison.
He is pre-eminently an intellectual poet, to whom the tree
of knowledge had been the tree of life; there is perhaps
scarcely a thought in his writings that charms by absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
simplicity and pure nature. Wherever, therefore, Chaucer
is transparently simple and unaffected, we find him altered
for the worse in Dryden. The very important part, however,
of <i>The Knight&#8217;s Tale</i> which is concerned with courts,
camps, and chivalry is even better in Dryden than in his
model. He might have defined his sphere in the words of
Ariosto, a poet who has many points of contact with
him:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Le donne, i cavalier, l&#8217;arme, gli amori,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le cortesie, l&#8217;audaci imprese io canto.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If this is true of portions of <i>Palamon and Arcite</i>, it is still
truer of <i>The Flower and the Leaf</i> (then believed to be
a genuine work of Chaucer&#8217;s), throughout a most brilliant
picture of natural beauty and courtly glitter, painted
in language of chastened splendour. The other pieces
modelled after Chaucer are of inferior interest, yet all excellent
in their way. Two of the three tales from Boccaccio
are acknowledged masterpieces, <i>Cymon and Iphigenia</i> and
<i>Theodore and Honoria</i>. The interest of the first chiefly
consists in the narrative itself, and that of the second in the
way of telling it. The story, indeed, though striking, is
fantastic and hardly pleasing, but Dryden&#8217;s treatment of it
is perhaps the most perfect specimen in our language of
<i>l&#8217;art de conter</i>.</p>

<p>An example of Dryden&#8217;s descriptive power may be given
in a passage from <i>The Flower and the Leaf</i>:</p>

<p>One remarkable feature of the principal poets of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is the infrequency of
the casual visitations of the Muse. They seem to have
hardly ever experienced an unsought lyrical inspiration, or
to have sung merely for singing&#8217;s sake. Hence Dryden is
permitted to appear only twice in the <i>Golden Treasury</i>.
His songs, to be treated of more fully when we consider the
lyrical poetry of the period, though often instinct with true
lyrical spirit, seem to have been deliberately composed for
insertion in his plays, and the same is the case with almost
the whole of what he would have called his occasional
poetry. His two chief odes, <i>Alexander&#8217;s Feast</i> and the
memorial verses to Anne Killigrew, were indubitably commissions;
and it is probable that few of the epistles, elegies,
dedications, and prologues which form so considerable a
portion of his poetical works were composed without some
similar inducement. As a whole, this collection is creditable
to his powers of intellect, quickness of wit, and command
of nervous masculine diction. It is frequently the
work of a master, though conceived in the spirit of a journeyman.
The adulation of the patron or the defunct is
generally fulsome enough; yet some compliments are so
graceful that it is difficult not to believe them sincere, as
when he apostrophizes the Duchess of Ormond:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;O daughter of the Rose, whose cheeks unite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The differing titles of the Red and White!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who heaven&#8217;s alternate beauty well display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blush of morning and the milky way.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or the conclusion of his epistle to Kneller:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;More cannot be by mortal art exprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But venerable age shall add the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Time shall with his ready pencil stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retouch your figures with his ripening hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mellow your colours, and imbrown the teint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Add every grace which Time alone can grant;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To future ages shall your fame convey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give more beauties than he takes away.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or these from the epistle to his kinsman, John Driden,
more likely than any of the others to have been the unbought
manifestation of genuine regard:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;O true descendant of a patriot line!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who while thou shar&#8217;st their lustre lendest thine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafe this picture of thy soul to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis so far good as it resembles thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauties to the original I owe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which when I miss my own defects I show;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor think the kindred Muses thy disgrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A poet is not born in every race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two of a house few ages can afford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One to perform, another to record.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praiseworthy actions are by thee embraced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &#8217;tis my praise to make thy praises last.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The last couplet, excellent in sense, is an example of
Dryden&#8217;s one metrical defect. He is not sufficiently careful
to vary his vowel-sounds.</p>

<p class="gap4">Dryden&#8217;s translations alone would give him a conspicuous
place in English literature. The most important,
his complete version of Virgil, has been improved
upon in many ways, and yet after all it remains true,
that &#8216;Pitt is quoted, and Dryden read.&#8217; Had he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
translated Virgil, his renderings or imitations of Juvenal,
Horace, and others, would suffice to entitle him to no
inconsiderable rank among those who have enriched
their native literature from foreign stores. His principle
of translation was correct, and accords with that of the
greatest of English critics. Coleridge assured Wordsworth
that there were only two legitimate systems of
metrical translation, strict literality, or compensation
carried to its fullest extent. Dryden most probably had
not sufficient Latin to be literal; but in any case his
genius would have disdained such trammels, not to mention
the more prosaic, but not less potent consideration,
that what is written for bread must usually be written in
haste&mdash;a fact which weighed with Dryden when he discontinued
rhyme in his tragedies. Thus thrown back on the
system of compensation, he has richly repaid his authors
for the beauties of which he has bereaved them, by the
beauties which he has bestowed&mdash;or which, as he maintains,
were actually latent in them&mdash;and has expressed many of
their thoughts with even enhanced energy. He has, in
fact, made them write very much as they would have
written if they had been English poets of the seventeenth
century, and his work is less translation than transfusion.
They necessarily appear much metamorphosed
from the originals, but the fault is less that of Dryden
than of his age. Could he have attempted the same task
in our day with equal resources of genius, and on the same
principles of workmanship, he would have succeeded much
better, for he would have enjoyed more comprehension
of the spirit of his originals than was possible in the
seventeenth century. The scholarship of that age had not
vivified the information which it had amassed; the idealized,
but still vital conceptions of the Renaissance had
given place to inanimate conventionality; the people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Greece and Rome appeared to the moderns like people in
books; and such warm, affectionate contact between the
souls of the present and the past as afterwards inspired
Shelley&#8217;s versions from Homer and Euripides was in that
age impossible.</p>

<p class="gap4">So great and versatile were Dryden&#8217;s powers that, after
all that has been said, his performances as a lyric poet, as a
dramatist, and as a critic remain to be spoken of, and his
rank in each has to be recognized as that of the foremost
writer of his country in his own day. These will be treated
in their appropriate places. The present is, perhaps, the
most appropriate for a few words on his position as a poet.
It is most difficult to determine whether he and his successor,
Pope, should be placed at the bottom of the first
class, or at the head of the second class of great English
poets. If the very highest gifts of all&mdash;originality, creative
imagination, unstudied music, unconscious inspiration,
lofty ideal, the power to interpret nature, are essential conditions
of rank in the first class, then assuredly Dryden
and Pope must be contented with the second. If not
positively excluded by the very nature of the case&mdash;if
deficiency in the very highest qualities can be compensated
by consummate excellence in all the rest&mdash;if intellect will
supply the place of inspiration, and art that of nature&mdash;then
they stand so high above the average of the second
rank that it seems injurious not to place them in the first.
The principle of exclusion, logically carried out, might
involve the elevation above them of other writers whom
we instinctively feel to be their inferiors; too absolute an
insistence, on the other hand, upon the claims of intellectual
power and perfect execution as qualifications for supreme
poetical rank, must result in preferring Pope to Dryden.
Inferior to his successor in both these respects, Dryden may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
still justly be preferred to him on the ground of his more
ample endowment with that divine insanity without which,
as Plato truly says, no one can be a poet. But this consideration
cannot be invoked in his favour against Pope
without admitting his inferiority to poets of the very first
order; and it may be seriously questioned whether any
poet can belong to the first order who is so exclusively a
town poet as Dryden and Pope, and has so little knowledge
of nature. The resemblances and contrasts between him
and Pope have been frequently discussed; there are two
other poets with whom comparison is less hackneyed and not
unprofitable. In fecundity, in versatility, in energy, in the
frequent application of his poetry to public affairs, in his
influence on contemporary literature, position as head of a
school, and incontestable superiority to all the poets
around him, no less, unfortunately, in bombast and incomprehensible
breaches of good taste, he strongly reminds us
of Victor Hugo. Hugo, undoubtedly, was a much greater
lyrical poet than Dryden, and was enkindled by spontaneous
inspirations which never visited Dryden; yet the
two are essentially of the same genus; the differences
between them are rather characteristic of their eras than of
themselves; and while Hugo&#8217;s imagination would have
pined in the seventeenth century, Dryden&#8217;s intellect and
Dryden&#8217;s modesty would have been highly serviceable to
Hugo in the nineteenth. Another poet, whose talent
and career offer many analogies to Dryden&#8217;s, is one
whom Dryden himself disparages upon metrical grounds.
Claudian, like Dryden, is a remarkable instance of a poet
owing a large portion of his fame to his dexterous treatment
of occasional subjects. As Dryden drew material for
his most powerful writings from the political and religious
controversies of his day, so Claudian found his themes in
the exploits of Stilicho and the misdeeds of Rufinus. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
have made uninteresting subjects attractive by admirable
treatment; both are greatly indebted to art and little to
nature; both in their latter days<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> sought relief from politics
in more ideal compositions, Dryden in his <i>Fables</i>, Claudian in
his <i>Rape of Proserpine</i>, a poem imbued with the characteristic
qualities of Dryden.</p>

<p>Among the greatest services which Dryden rendered to
our language and literature are to be reckoned his improvements
in heroic versification, of which he has left an
unsurpassed model.</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Waller was smooth, but Dryden taught to join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The varying verse, the full majestic line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long-resounding march, and energy divine.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>His changes, nevertheless, were not always improvements.
He is too uniform, though not absolutely uniform, in
confining the sense to the couplet; and, in adding dignity
to Chaucer&#8217;s verse, he has lost something of its sweetness.
Leigh Hunt well observes: &#8216;Though Dryden&#8217;s versification
is noble, beautiful, and so complete of its kind that to an
ear uninstructed in the metre of the old poet all comparison
between the two in this respect seems out of the question
and even ludicrous, yet the measure in which Dryden
wrote not only originated, but attained to a considerable
degree of its beauty in Chaucer; and the old poet&#8217;s immeasurable
superiority in sentiment and imagination, not
only to Dryden, but to all, up to a very late period, who
have written in the same form of verse, left him in possession
of beauties, even in versification, which it remains for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
some future poet to amalgamate with Dryden&#8217;s in a manner
worthy of both, and so carry England&#8217;s noble heroic rhyme
to its pitch of perfection.&#8217; It need not be said that Pope&#8217;s
magnificent eulogy solely respects Dryden as a rhyming
poet. His blank verse, though in general good enough for
the stage, and better than that of most of his contemporaries,
is utterly destitute of the sweetness and variety
of the Elizabethans.</p>

<p>Dryden&#8217;s works were edited with exemplary zeal and
fidelity by Sir Walter Scott. The standard modern edition
is Mr. Saintsbury&#8217;s; the one most convenient for general
use, Mr. Christie&#8217;s.</p>

<span class="smaller">POETS CONTEMPORARY WITH DRYDEN.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Oldham
(1653-1683).</div>

<p>The contemporary of Dryden who approached him most
nearly in satiric force, and, generally speaking,
in the borderland between poetry and prose,
was John Oldham (1653-1683). Not much
is known of his life. The son of a Nonconformist minister,
he nevertheless obtained a university education, but after
leaving college was glad to accept the position of usher in
Archbishop Whitgift&#8217;s free school at Croydon. Coming to
town he filled the post of tutor in various families, and by
his <i>Satires upon the Jesuits</i> (1681) gained the acquaintance
of Dryden and other men of letters and the patronage of
the Earl of Kingston, who seemed likely to provide for
him, but at whose seat in Nottinghamshire he died of the
smallpox, December, 1683.</p>

<p>Oldham&#8217;s poems consist partly of odes, formal and elaborate
compositions, and partly of the satires which in his
age in some measure supplied the place of the modern
journal and review. A secret and unconscious harmony
pervades all branches of the contemporary art of every
epoch; and in the stately and somewhat stilted lyrics of
Oldham and his compeers we discern the counterpart of the
elaborate frontispieces with temples and triumphal arches,
chariots and cornucopias, tritons and nereids, which the
engravers of the age prefixed to its literature. The en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>graving
is hardly art, and the verse is hardly poetry; we are
nevertheless conscious of a vigour and a substance which
command respect. The work is compact and solid at any
rate, and displays much of the force of the Giants, if little
of the inspiration of the Gods. Oldham would fain be
extravagant in praise of wine; but there is not the least
trace of genuine Bacchic frenzy in his laboured dithyramb.
The epicedion on his friend Mouvent is a serious composition
indeed, forty-two mortal stanzas, with, nevertheless,
sufficient good things to justify the praise bestowed on it
by Pope. The ode to Ben Jonson is remarkable as expressing
the feelings of the men of the Restoration towards the
poet who they really thought had reformed the stage, and
delivered it from the reprehensible licentiousness of Shakespeare.
Like Oldham&#8217;s other lyrical compositions, it
abounds with most dissonant lines, but has also some noble
ones, as these, for example:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Let meaner spirits stoop to low precarious fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Content on gross and coarse applause to live<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And what the dull and senseless rabble give;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou didst it still with noble scorn contemn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor wouldst that wretched alms receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor subsistence of some bankrupt, sordid name:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thine was no empty vapour, raised beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And formed of common breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The false and foolish fire, that&#8217;s whisked about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By popular air, and glares awhile, and then goes out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But &#8217;twas a solid, whole, and perfect globe of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That shone all over, was all over bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dared all sullying clouds, and feared no darkening night.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Oldham&#8217;s principal celebrity, however, is derived from
his satires. He had the knack of stinging invective, and
has been not unjustly compared to Churchill. His <i>Satires
on the Jesuits</i> exactly suited the time of the Popish Plot,
at present they repel by their one-sidedness. All satire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
except that inspired by fancy, is apt to become repulsive
by its natural tendency to dwell upon the meanest and
lowest aspects of human nature; and this is pre-eminently
the case with Oldham, who is always ridiculing or denouncing,
always drawing his illustrations from the base
and offensive, and seldom diversifies his low matter with
an ennobling thought. Yet he evinces so much manly
sense, and his style is so nervous, that it is impossible not
to admire his vigour, and wish him a more inviting subject.
His metre and rhyme frequently stand in need of Dryden&#8217;s
generous apology:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;O early ripe! to thy abundant store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could advancing age have added more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might, what Nature never gives the young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have taught the smoothness of thy native tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But satire needs not these, and wit will shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>All this notwithstanding, Oldham had the root of the
matter in him, and has described, as only a poet could, the
ambition, the toil, and the triumph of a poet:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">With unfelt throes, brings its rude issue forth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, after, when imperfect, shapeless thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is, by the judgment, into fashion wrought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When at first search, I traverse o&#8217;er my mind,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Oldham&#8217;s talent, depending upon masculine sense and
vigour of expression rather than upon the more ethereal
graces of poetry, was of the kind to expand and mellow by
age and practice. Had he lived longer he would undoubtedly
have left a name conspicuous in English literature.
As it is, he can only be regarded as a bright satellite
revolving at a respectful distance around the all-illumining
orb of Dryden. Before passing to Marvell and Butler, the
only two really original poets after Dryden besides the
veterans Cowley and Waller, who belong to the preceding
period, it will be convenient to despatch a group of minor
bards, whose inclusion in the standard collections of poetry,
involving memoirs by a master of biography, has given
them more celebrity than they in most instances deserve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Rochester
(1647-1680).</div>

<p>John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1647-1680), is principally
known to posterity by his vices and
his repentance. The latter has helped to
preserve the memory of the former, which
have also left abiding traces in a number of poems not included
in his works, and some of which, it may be hoped,
are wrongly attributed to him. For a number of years
Rochester obtained notoriety as, after Buckingham, the
most dissolute character of a dissolute age; but at the
same time a critic and a wit, potent to make or mar the
fortunes of men of letters. &#8216;Sure,&#8217; says Mr. Saintsbury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
&#8216;to play some monkey trick or other on those who were unfortunate
enough to be his intimates.&#8217; Many a literary
cabal was instigated by him, many a libel and lampoon
flowed from his pen, among others, <i>The Session of the Poets</i>,
correctly characterized by Johnson as &#8216;merciless insolence.&#8217;
Worn out by a life of excess, he died at thirty-three, and
his penitence, largely due to the arguments and exhortations
of Burnet, afforded the latter material for a narrative
which Johnson, entirely opposed as he was to the author&#8217;s
political and ecclesiastical principles, declares that &#8216;the
critic ought to read for its elegance, the philosopher for
its arguments, and the saint for its piety.&#8217;</p>

<p>Rochester&#8217;s acknowledged poems fall into two divisions
of unequal merit. The lyrical and amatory are in general
very insipid. The more serious pieces, especially when expressing
the discomfort of a sated votary of pleasure,
frequently want neither force nor weight. Four particularly
fine lines, quoted without indication of authorship
in Goethe&#8217;s <i>Wahrheit und Dichtung</i>, have frequently occasioned
speculation as to their origin. They come from
Rochester&#8217;s <i>Satyr against Mankind</i>, and read:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Then Old Age and Experience, hand in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead him to Death, and make him understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a search so painful and so long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all his life he has been in the wrong.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Goldsmith&#8217;s &#8216;best-natured man, with the worst-natured
muse,&#8217; is purloined from Rochester, who is also the propounder
of the paradox, &#8216;All men would be cowards if they
durst.&#8217; Some of his songs are not devoid of merit. After
all, however, nothing of his is so well known as the anticipatory
epitaph on Charles II., ascribed sometimes to
him, sometimes to Buckingham, and very likely due to
neither:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Here lies our mutton-eating king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose word no man relies on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who never said a foolish thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never did a wise one.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Wentworth Dillon, Earl of Roscommon (1633?-1684),
was a very different character, both as a man and as a
poet. He is accused of no fault but a love of gaming, and
the purity of his Muse merited the well-known eulogium:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&#8216;In all Charles&#8217;s days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roscommon only boasts unsullied bays.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But he has nothing of the salt and savour of Rochester&#8217;s
more serious poetry, and is at best an elegant versifier,
who, in his only considerable original poem, the <i>Essay on
Translated Verse</i>, thinks justly, reasons clearly, and expresses
himself with considerable spirit when the subject
requires. The most original feature of his literary character
is his preference in a rhyming age for blank verse, which
he enforces in theory, but is far from recommending by
his practice. In his rhymed pieces he is a better versifier
than poet, and in his blank verse the contrary. Milton&#8217;s
eyes were just closed; Shakespeare and Fletcher were still
acted; but the secret of beautiful versification, apart from
rhyme, seems to have been entirely lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Sheffield,
Duke of Buckinghamshire
(1649-1721).</div>

<p>Poetry afforded a subject for verse to another noble
writer, John Sheffield, successively Earl
of Mulgrave, Marquis of Normanby, and
Duke of Buckinghamshire (1649-1721),
who achieved real if moderate distinction
as soldier, statesman, and scholar. As a poet his reputation
rests entirely upon his <i>Essay on Poetry</i>, which contains many
just thoughts expressed in pleasing numbers, although the
author&#8217;s deference to the conventional dicta of criticism
leads him into idolatry, not only of Homer and Virgil, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of Bossu. To have fostered the genius of Pope by judicious
praise is the highest distinction of &#8216;Granville the polite and
knowing Walsh.&#8217; Congreve, to be treated more fully as a
dramatist, stands somewhat higher than these as an inditer
of heroic couplets; but a severer criticism must be passed,
if any criticism is needed, upon Pomfret, Duke, Stepney,
and the other versifiers of the day who have burrowed their
way into the stock collections of poetry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Andrew Marvell
(1621-1678).</div>

<p>Andrew Marvell was a virtuous man whose good qualities
contrast so forcibly with the characteristic
failings of his age, that he appears by
contrast even more virtuous than he
actually was. His integrity made him the hero of legend,
for, although the Court would no doubt have been glad to
gain him, it is hardly credible that the prime minister
should by the king&#8217;s order have personally waited upon
him &#8216;up two pair of stairs in a little court in the Strand.&#8217;
But the apocryphal anecdote attests the real veneration
inspired by his independence in a venal age. Born in the
neighbourhood of Hull on March 31st, 1621, he studied at
Cambridge, travelled for some years on the Continent, and
settled down about 1650 as tutor to the daughter of Lord
Fairfax. At this period he wrote his exquisite poem, <i>The
Garden</i>, and other pieces of a similar character. He also
wrote in 1650 the poem on Cromwell&#8217;s return from Ireland,
which may have gained for him in 1653 the appointment
of tutor to Cromwell&#8217;s ward, William Dutton. Other
pieces of a like description followed, and in 1657 Marvell
became joint Latin secretary with Milton, an office for
which Milton had recommended him four years previously.
His poem on the Protector&#8217;s death in the following year is
justly declared by Mr. Firth to be &#8216;the only one distinguished
by an accent of sincerity and personal affection.&#8217;
He was elected for Hull to Richard Cromwell&#8217;s Parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and continued to sit for the remainder of his life. He was
the last Member of Parliament who received a salary from
his constituents, to whose interests he in return attended
so diligently that upwards of three hundred letters from
him upon their concerns and general politics are extant in
the Hull archives.</p>

<p>Marvell could scarcely be called a republican. He had
been devoted to the Protectorate, and would probably have
been easily reconciled to the Restoration if the government
had been ably and honestly conducted. In wrath at the
general maladministration he betook himself to satires, which
circulated in manuscript. At first he attacked Clarendon,
but eventually concluded that the only remedy would be
the final expulsion of the house of Stuart. In 1672 and
1673 he appeared in print as a prose controversialist with
<i>The Rehearsal Transprosed</i>, a witty attack on a work by
Parker, Bishop of Oxford, wherein, in the author&#8217;s own
words, &#8216;the mischiefs and inconveniences of toleration were
represented, and all pretences pleaded in behalf of liberty
of conscience fully answered.&#8217; He silenced his opponent,
and escaped being himself silenced through the interposition
of Charles II., whose native good sense and easiness
of temper inclined him to toleration, and who promoted the
freedom of Nonconformists as a means of obtaining liberty
for the Church of Rome. Marvell, however, was not to be
reconciled, and in 1677 put forth an anonymous pamphlet
to prove, what was but too true, that a design had long
been on foot to establish absolute monarchy and subvert the
Protestant religion. His sudden death on August 18th,
1678, was attributed to poison, but, according to a physician
who wrote some years afterwards, was occasioned by that
prejudice of the faculty against Peruvian bark which is
recorded by Temple and Evelyn.</p>

<p>As a writer of prose, Marvell is both powerful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
humorous, but is not a Junius or a Pascal to impart permanent
interest to transitory themes, and make the topics
of the day topics for all time. As a poet he ranks with
those who have been said to be stars alike of evening and
of morning. His earliest and most truly poetical compositions
belong in spirit to the period of Charles I., when
the strains of the Elizabethan lyric were yet lingering.
After passing through a transition stage of manly verse
still breathing a truly poetical spirit, but mainly concerned
with public affairs, he settles down as a satirist endowed
with all the vigour, but, at the same time, with all the
prosaic hardness of the Restoration. His most inspired
poem, <i>Thoughts in a Garden</i>, written under the Commonwealth,
and originally composed in Latin, nevertheless
rings like a voice from beyond the Civil Wars. Here are
the three loveliest of nine lovely stanzas:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;What wondrous life is this I lead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ripe apples drop about my head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The luscious clusters of the vine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my mouth do crush their wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nectarine and curious peach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into my hands themselves do reach;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stumbling on melons as I pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withdraws into its happiness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mind, that ocean where each kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does straight its own resemblance find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet it creates, transcending these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far other worlds, and other seas;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Annihilating all that&#8217;s made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a green thought in a green shade.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Here at the fountain&#8217;s sliding foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or at some fruit-tree&#8217;s mossy root,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Casting the body&#8217;s vest aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul into the boughs does glide:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, like a bird, it sits and sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There whets and claps its silver wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, till prepared for longer flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waves in its plumes the various light.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8216;These wonderful verses,&#8217; says Mr. Palgrave of the entire
poem, &#8216;may be regarded as a test of any reader&#8217;s insight
into the most poetical aspects of poetry.&#8217;</p>

<p>As a satirist it is Marvell&#8217;s error to confound satire with
lampoon. He has the <i>saeva indignatio</i> which makes the
avenger, but spends too much of it upon individuals.
Occasionally some fine personification gives promise of
better things, but the poet soon relapses into mere personalities.
This may be attributed in great measure to the
circumstances under which these compositions appeared.
They could only be circulated clandestinely, and the writer
may be excused if he did not labour to exalt what he himself
regarded as mere fugitive poetry. The most celebrated
of these pieces are the series of <i>Advices to a Painter</i>, in
which the persons and events of the day are described to
an imaginary artist for delineation in fitting, and therefore
by no means flattering, colours. It is to Marvell&#8217;s honour
that he succeeds best with a fine subject. When, in his
poems on the events of the Commonwealth, he escapes
from mere sarcasm and negation, and speaks nobly upon
really noble themes, he soars far above the Marvell of the
Restoration, though even here his verse is marred by lapses
into the commonplace, and by his besetting infirmity of an
inability to finish with effect, leaving off like a speaker
who sits down rather from the failure of his voice than
the exhaustion of his theme. The panegyric on Cromwell&#8217;s
anniversary, and the poem on his death, abound nevertheless
with fine, though faulty passages, of which the following
may serve as an example:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;O human glory vain! O Death! O wings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O worthless world! O transitory things!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dwelt that greatness in his shape decayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That still, though dead, greater than death he laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his altered face you something feign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That threatens Death he yet will live again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not much unlike the sacred oak which shoots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven its branches, and through earth its roots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose spacious boughs are hung with trophies round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honoured wreaths have oft the victor crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When angry Jove darts lightning through the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At mortal sins, nor his own plant will spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It groans and bruises all below, that stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many years the shelter of the wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tree, erewhile foreshortened to our view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fallen shows taller yet than as it grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall his praise to after times increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When truth shall be allowed, and faction cease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his own shadows with him fall; the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Detracts from objects than itself more high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when Death takes from them that envied state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing how little, we confess how great.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Marvell&#8217;s position as the satirist of his era from the
Puritan and Republican point of view, was filled upon the
Cavalier side by Samuel Butler, who, if general reputation
and excellence in his own walk of verse are to be allowed as
criterions, may claim to be the third poet of the age after
Milton and Dryden. It is true that Butler, though endowed
with abundance of fancy, was, strictly speaking, no
poet; that he is entirely destitute of the dignity and
tenderness which Marvell can display with a congenial
theme; and that he possesses nothing of Dryden&#8217;s power
of exalting unpromising subjects into poetry. But he
infinitely surpasses Marvell when they meet on the common
ground of satire; and though he cannot be said to surpass
Dryden, their methods are so different that no proper comparison
can be drawn. When writing in Dryden&#8217;s manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Butler is respectable, but he has the field of burlesque epic
entirely to himself. Supremacy in a low style of composition
is a surer passport to fame than moderate merit in a
high one. With all the defects of Restoration literature,
it had a faculty for producing masterpieces, and it must be
admitted that Butler&#8217;s <i>Hudibras</i> stands as decidedly at the
head of its class as <i>Paradise Lost</i>, or <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>,
or <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>, or Pepys&#8217;s <i>Diary</i> at the head
of theirs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Samuel Butler
(1612-1680).</div>

<p>Samuel Butler was born near Worcester in 1612. His
father, a small farmer, procured him a good
education at the Worcester Grammar School.
His first employment was that of clerk to a
country justice named Jefferys. He afterwards entered
the household of Elizabeth, Countess of Kent, at Wrest, in
Bedfordshire, and subsequently acted as clerk to various
justices of the peace, one of whom, Sir Samuel Luke, of
Cople Hoo, near Bedford, served as the original of Hudibras.
It is curious to reflect that John Bunyan was at the
same time going through his spiritual conflicts in the same
county. He seems to have also travelled in France and
Holland. He published nothing until 1659, when an
anonymous tract in favour of the restoration of the
monarchy, entitled <i>Mola Asinaria</i>, appeared from his pen.
The service was recompensed by the appointment of secretary
to the Earl of Carbury, Lord President of Wales,
who made him steward of Ludlow Castle, where <i>Comus</i>
had been performed nearly thirty years before. He resigned
this charge upon contracting what seemed a wealthy
marriage, but the lady&#8217;s money was lost, and, notwithstanding
the great literary success <i>Hudibras</i>, the remainder of
the author&#8217;s life was spent in poverty. The first part of
<i>Hudibras</i>, stated in the title to have been written during
the Civil War, and if so at least fifteen years old, was pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>lished
in 1663. Its success was instantaneous, though
neither the Puritans nor Mr. Pepys could quite see the
joke. The merit of the performance, however, was fully
apparent to a better and more influential judge, the king,
who encouraged the author by giving numerous copies
away, though history does not say at whose expense. But
this was all he gave, and the poet who had rendered such
essential service to the royalist cause by his writings was
as completely neglected by the Court as if he had been
John Milton. It is indeed said that he was in receipt of a
pension of 100 at his death; but this seems contradicted
by the letter, already quoted, of Dryden to the Lord High
Treasurer within two years after Butler&#8217;s death, where he
says: &#8216;&#8217;Tis enough for one age to have neglected Mr.
Cowley and starved Mr. Butler.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Oldham&#8217;s lines, written
at the same time, are still more emphatic:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;On Butler who can think without just rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory and the scandal of the age?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Met everywhere with welcomes of renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Courted and loved by all, with wonder read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And promises of princely favour fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what reward for all had he at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a life of dull expectance passed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretch at summing up his misspent days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found nothing left but poverty and praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his gains by verse he could not save<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To rid him hence, and his worse fate prevent.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These spirited verses are certainly exaggerated. Butler,
though, as his biographer says, &#8216;personally known to few,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>&#8217;
partook on the same authority of the munificence of
Dorset, and dying on September 25th, 1680, was buried on
September 27th in the churchyard of St. Paul&#8217;s, Covent
Garden, at the expense of another friend, William Longueville,
bencher of the Inner Temple, who had previously
endeavoured to obtain his interment in Westminster
Abbey, where, Atterbury being dean, a tardy monument
was erected to him in 1721 by Alderman Barber. Very
little is known of the latter years of his life, except that
he lived in Rose Street, Covent Garden, and that
he suffered much from the gout. He had published
a second part of <i>Hudibras</i> in 1664, and a third in 1678,
containing many allusions to events much later than the
Civil War. He bequeathed his posthumous papers to
Longueville, by whom they were carefully preserved, and
a large portion eventually came to be published in 1759.
They will be treated of in another place. Not much is
known of Butler&#8217;s personal character and habits. He
must evidently have been a man of extensive reading, and
versed in several languages and literatures. It seems
natural to attribute the neglect of so popular an author to
some infirmity in his own temper, but the little testimony
we have makes the other way. Wood describes him as &#8216;a
boon and witty companion;&#8217; and Aubrey says, &#8216;A severe
and sound judgment, a good fellow.&#8217; It must be remembered
that he was forty-eight at the Restoration, and had
spent almost all his life in the country; we shall also find
reason to believe that he was neither enough of a churchman
nor enough of a loyalist to be entirely agreeable to his
own party.</p>

<p>The defect in <i>Hudibras</i> pointed out by Dr. Johnson, the
want of logical sequence in the action, undoubtedly exists,
but is almost inherent in the conception of such a performance.
A more serious drawback, the disproportion be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>tween
the hero&#8217;s deeds and his words, probably arises from
the poem having been written at different periods of the
author&#8217;s life. When he began to write his invention was
lively and vigorous, but it naturally flagged after middle
age, although his wit remained unimpaired. In the first
and part of the second canto disquisition and adventure
are so evenly blended that each supports the other; in the
latter part of the poem the burden falls almost entirely
upon the former. Hence the picturesque and cleverly
varied incident of the bear-baiting, with the varied characters
it brings upon the scene, will always be the
favourite passage of the poem, unless an exception be
made for the portraits of Hudibras and Ralpho. There is,
however, considerable inconsistency in the character of
Hudibras. He is represented as a fool, yet half the good
things of the book are, from sheer necessity, put into his
mouth. We are to suppose him a coward, yet he takes
and deals cuffs and bangs in the spirit of a pugilist; and
his attack upon the seven champions of bear-baiting, one
of them an Amazon, is so far from cowardice, that it more
resembles temerity. The more odious traits of his character
hardly seem properly to belong to it; and in fact Butler
probably commenced his poem without too curiously considering
how he was to conduct it, or rather where it was
to conduct him, and scribbled away in the spirit of his own
maxim&mdash;</p>

<p>trusting to the humour ever springing up under his pen to
redeem his verse from the imputation of doggrel. This it
certainly did; for although <i>Hudibras</i> as a whole is rambling,
ill-compacted, and wordy, the terseness of many individual
passages is as remarkable as their humour:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Butler&#8217;s <i>Hudibras</i> may perhaps be best defined as a
metrical parody upon <i>Don Quixote</i>, with a spice of
allusion to the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, in which the nobility and
pathos of the originals are designedly obliterated, and
the humour exaggerated into farce to suit the author&#8217;s
polemic purpose. His design is to kill Presbyterianism
and Independency by ridicule, and he is consequently
compelled to shut his eyes to everything in them except
their occasional tendency to baseness, and their perpetual
liability to cant. This is the constant Nemesis of the
satirist; but Butler is even more of a caricaturist than the
situation called for. The endurance of his poem to our
own times, however, is sufficient proof that, although a
caricature, it was not a libel, and amid the enthusiastic
reaction of the Restoration it may well have passed for a
fair portrait. The machinery is closely modelled upon
<i>Don Quixote</i>. Presbyterianism is incarnated in the doughty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
justice of the peace, Sir Hudibras; Independency and new
light sectarianism in general in his squire, Ralpho; and the
two sally forth in quest of adventure quite in the style of
Don Quixote and Sancho, except that the Don&#8217;s great aim
is to deliver damsels, and Hudibras&#8217;s to imprison them.
Though the scene appears to be laid in the west of England,
there is no reason to doubt the tradition that the prototype
of Hudibras&#8217;s satire was Butler&#8217;s master, the Bedfordshire
magistrate, Sir Samuel Luke, who is evidently alluded to
where a rhyme to <i>Mameluke</i> is left blank to be supplied by
the reader&#8217;s ingenuity. If, as is more than probable, this
worthy justice was given to suppressing bear-baitings,
Butler would need no more material for his burlesque;
and the first part of the poem, at all events, may well have
been written while he was in Sir Samuel&#8217;s employment. It
seems, from internal evidence, to have been composed before
Cromwell had ejected the Long Parliament, and its general
atmosphere almost precludes the idea of its having been
written after the execution of Charles I. The second part
has many allusions to later events. The description of
Hudibras, mind and body, is so vivid and precise as to
present internal evidence of having been drawn from a
living model, while Ralpho is in comparison vague. Soon
after sallying forth the pair find themselves at odds with
a crowd about to revel in the amusement of bear-baiting,
which they proceed to interrupt; not, as has been remarked,
out of compassion to the bear, but out of grudge to the
public. This brings on a fight, most amusingly described,
but at somewhat too great length; the &#8216;fatal facility&#8217; of
the octosyllabic couplet being nowhere more conspicuous
than in Butler&#8217;s humorous doggrel. After various turns
of fortune, the knight and squire find themselves in the
stocks, where they sit until Hudibras&#8217;s lady-love, a frolicsome
widow with a jointure, appears to the rescue:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>The mischievous lady, nevertheless, only consents to liberate
Hudibras upon condition that he shall administer a sound
flogging to himself. Hudibras willingly promises this,
and is released, but next day he thinks better of it, and
consults Ralpho whether he is actually bound by his oath.
Ralpho&#8217;s reply abounds with the pithy couplets so frequent
in <i>Hudibras</i>, which have become a part of the language:</p>

<p>Hudibras, however, is but half convinced, or rather,
doubts whether conviction can be brought to the minds of
others. He bethinks himself of a middle course, and
suggests that the whipping shall be inflicted by proxy, and
that Ralpho shall be the proxy. To this Ralpho demurs,
and an impending rupture is only averted by a new adventure,
which seems invented for the purpose. When it is
over Hudibras has profited by the interval of reflection to
resolve to consult the wizard Sidrophel, who is apparently
intended for Lilly. The scene affords Butler an opportunity
of venting the dislike to physical science which he
shared with so many other literary men, and to which
he gave more definite expression in <i>The Elephant in the
Moon</i>. The interview terminates in a scuffle, in which
Hudibras overthrows Sidrophel, and, thinking he has killed
him, makes off, leaving Ralpho, as he deems, to bear the
brunt. The trusty squire, however, has already gone to
the lady with the tale of Hudibras&#8217;s perjury, which insures
the knight a warm reception. Here the action of the story
ends, the remainder of the poem being chiefly occupied by
&#8216;heroical epistles&#8217; between the parties, which do not help
it on, and by a digression on the downfall of the Rump,
chiefly remarkable for allusions to politics of later date.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable phenomena in Butler is, that
after all this Cavalier poet is little of a Cavalier, and this
assailant of Puritanism little of a Churchman. His loyalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
is but hatred of anarchy, and his religion but hatred of
cant. The genuineness of both these feelings is attested
by the detached thoughts found among his papers; otherwise
it might fairly have been doubted whether his motive
for espousing the royalist cause had been any other than
the infinitely greater scope which Puritanism and Republicanism
offered to the shafts of a satirist. The follies
of the Cavalier party proved that things may be absurd
without being ridiculous; those of their opponents demonstrated
that ridicule may justly attach to things not intrinsically
absurd. It is clear, notwithstanding, from Butler&#8217;s
prose remains, that he was constitutionally hostile to
liberty in politics and to the inward light in religion, and
that he obeyed his own sincere conviction in attacking
them. But it is equally clear that his preference for
monarchy was solely utilitarian, and that his preferences
in religion were determined simply by taste. The ground
of his acquiescence in the Church of England is thus
frankly stated by himself in one of his detached thoughts:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Men ought to do in religion as they do in war. When a man
of honour is overpowered, and must of necessity surrender himself
up a prisoner, such are always wont to endeavour to do it
to some person of command and quality, and not to a mere
scoundrel. So, since all men are obliged to be of some church,
it is more honourable, if there were nothing else in it, to be of
that which has some reputation, than such a one as is contemptible,
and justly despised by all the best of men.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not the language of a very fervent churchman;
and Butler&#8217;s royalism is like his religion, a <i>pis aller</i>.
Nowhere does his aversion for Puritanism kindle into
enthusiasm for its contrary, any more than his humour ever
rises into poetry. In his verse he is a satirist; in his prose
a sceptic; and his satire and his scepticism are alike rooted
in a low opinion of human nature, and a disbelief that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
things can ever be much better than they are. He is a
strong spirit, but of the earth, earthy. At the same time
he is not one of the satirists who make their readers cynics;
on the contrary, his hearty geniality puts the reader into
good humour with mankind, and suggests that if there is
not much to admire there is also but little to condemn. It
is unnecessary to dilate on his peculiar merits, which are
of universal notoriety. Few have enriched the language
with so many familiar quotations; few have so much fancy
along with a total absence of sentiment; few have been so
fertile in odd rhymes and quaint illustrations and comparisons;
few have so thoroughly combined the characters
of wit and humorist.</p>

<p>In 1759 a quantity of MS. compositions of Butler&#8217;s,
which had remained unpublished during his life, and had
come into the possession of his friend Longueville, were
edited by R. Thyer, librarian of the Chetham Library at
Manchester. The most important, his characters in the
manner of Theophrastus, and detached thoughts in prose,
will be noticed along with the prose essayists. Of the
metrical compositions, the most elaborate is <i>The Elephant
in the Moon</i>, a satire on the appetite for marvels displayed
by some of the members of the then infant Royal Society,
which exists in two recensions, one in Hudibrastic, the
other in heroic verse. The other pieces are also for the
most part satirical, with a strong affinity to <i>Hudibras</i>,
except where they parody the style of some poet of the
day. They are always clever, sometimes very humorous
and pointed, and, with Marvell&#8217;s satires, form a transition
from the unpolished quaintness of Donne to the weight
and splendour of Dryden. Butler in one instance appears
a downright plagiarist; in another he would seem, were the
thing possible, to have been copied by a later and more
illustrious writer. In his satire against rhyme, he writes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>This is undoubtedly Boileau&#8217;s &#8216;La raison dit Virgile, et
la rime Quinault.&#8217; In <i>Cat and Puss</i>, on the other hand, an
amusing parody of the rhyming tragedy of his day, he
observes of the feline Lothario:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="smaller">LYRIC POETRY.</span></h2>

<p>It is entirely in keeping with the solid and terrestrial
character of Restoration literature in general, that no
description of poetry should manifest so grievous a lapse
from the standard of the preceding age as the lyrical. The
decline of the drama has attracted more attention, partly
from the violent contrast of two schools which had hardly
one principle or one method in common, partly because
our own age had but imperfectly realized the exceeding
wealth in song of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods,
until Mr. Arthur Bullen showed what unsuspected
treasures of poetry were hidden in old music books.
Whatever else an Elizabethan or Jacobean lyric may be, it
is almost certain to be melodious. The average Restoration
lyric is correct enough in scansion, but the melody is
conventional, poor and thin. Here and there, and especially
in Dryden, we are surprised by a fine exception;
but as a rule the Restoration song is deficient alike in the
simple spontaneity which inspired such pieces as <i>Come live
with me and be my love</i>, and in the more intricate harmonies
of its predecessors. It was as though a blight had
suddenly fallen upon the nation, and men&#8217;s ears had
become incapable of distinguishing between sweetness and
smoothness. So, indeed, they had as respected the music
of verse; but how little technical music, whether vocal or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
instrumental, was neglected, even in private circles, we may
learn from Pepys&#8217;s <i>Diary</i>, and it is a remarkable proof how
little this music and the music of poetry have to do with
each other, that this age of degeneracy in the one produced
the greatest of all English masters, Purcell, in the other;
while the still more hopelessly unmelodious age of the first
Georges was the age of Handel. Poetry makes melody,
not melody poetry; and the only explanation is, that the
age preceding that of the Restoration was poetical, and the
Restoration age was prosaic. It could not well have been
otherwise if, as all critics agree, the special literary mission
of the Restoration period was to prune the luxuriance
of English prose, and by introducing conciseness,
perspicuity, and logical order, to render it a fit instrument
for narrative, reasoning, and the despatch of business.</p>

<p>Such lyric as the age possessed is almost entirely comprehended
in Dryden; for Marvell, of whom we must
nevertheless speak, belongs in spirit to a former age. The
songs in Dryden&#8217;s plays, to be mentioned shortly, prove
that he was by no means destitute of spontaneous lyrical
feeling; but he no doubt succeeded best when, having first
penetrated himself with a theme sufficiently stirring to
generate the enthusiastic mood which finds its natural expression
in song, he sat down to frame a fitting accompaniment
by the aid of all the resources of metrical art. The principal
examples of this lyrical magnificence which he has given
us are the elegy on Anne Killigrew and the two odes on
St. Cecilia&#8217;s Day. Of the first of these two latter, Johnson
says that &#8216;it is lost in the splendour of the second,&#8217; and
such is the fact; but had Dryden produced no other lyric,
he would still have ranked as a fine lyrical poet. Of the
second ode, better known as <i>Alexander&#8217;s Feast</i>, it is needless
to say anything, for all readers of poetry have it by
heart, and all recognize its claim to rank among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
greatest odes in the language&mdash;the greatest, perhaps, until
Wordsworth and Shelley wrote, and little, if at all, behind
even them. Johnson, indeed, prefers the memorial ode on
Anne Killigrew, and if all the stanzas equalled the first
he would be right; but this is impossible; as he himself
remarks, &#8216;An imperial crown cannot be one continued
diamond.&#8217; The inevitable falling off, nevertheless, would
have been less apparent if Dryden had shown more judgment
in the selection of his topics, or at least more tact in
handling them. The morals of the age were, indeed, bad
enough, as he well knew who had helped to make them
so; but such frank treatment of a disagreeable theme jars
exceedingly with an ode devoted to the celebration of
chastity and virtue. Notwithstanding this flaw, the entire
ode deserves Mr. Saintsbury&#8217;s eulogy, &#8216;As a piece of concerted
music in verse it has not a superior.&#8217; The hyperbolical
praise of Anne Killigrew&#8217;s now forgotten poems is
explained, and in some measure excused, by the fact that it
was written to be prefixed to them. The first stanza,
appropriate to thousands beside its ostensible subject,
appeals to the general human heart, and indicates the high-water
mark of Restoration poetry:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">In spreading branches more sublimely rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich with immortal green above the rest:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or, called to more superior bliss,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The poet who so excelled in majestic artificial harmonies
was also the one poet of his day who could occasionally
sing as the bird sings. Dryden has never received sufficient
praise for his songs, inasmuch as these are mostly
hidden away in his dramas, and not always adapted for
quotation. The following, with a manifest political meaning,
is a good example of his simple ease and melody:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;A choir of bright beauties in spring did appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To choose a May-lady to govern the year;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The garland was given, and Phyllis was queen:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then laurels and myrtles your brows shall adorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Pan and his son and fair Syrinx return.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The following song is from <i>The Mock Astrologer</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;You charmed me not with that fair face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though it was all divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be another&#8217;s is the grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes me wish you mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods and fortune take their part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who like young monarchs fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boldly dare invade that heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is another&#8217;s right.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A dull defensive war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now every friend is turned a foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hope to get our store:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passion makes us cowards grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made us brave before.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Muse who could mourn to such purpose for
Anne Killigrew might have been expected to soar high in
celebrating and lamenting Charles II., parts of whose
history and character certainly lent themselves to poetry.
Whether from haste, indifference, or whatever reason,
Dryden was clearly unable to penetrate himself with the
subject, and it is perhaps to his honour that his composition
should so little simulate an inspiration he was evidently
far from feeling. The choice of subjects is judicious,
but the treatment is in general inanimate and
perfunctory, except when the poet is going to say something
absurd, and then his motto is <i>Pecca fortiter</i>. There
is, perhaps, nothing nearer burlesque in all Dryden&#8217;s
rhyming plays than this couplet:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Ere a prince is to perfection brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He costs Omnipotence a second thought.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The poet is also weighted by having to flatter Charles and
his successor at the same time. The concluding lines,
however, eulogizing James&#8217;s care for the navy, will always
echo in the heart of Britain:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Behold even the remoter shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A conquering navy proudly spread:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The British cannon formidably roars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, starting from his oozy bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The asserted Ocean rears his reverend head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view and recognize his ancient Lord again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a willing hand restores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fasces of the main.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This latter fine phrase had occurred already in <i>Astraea
Redux</i> and <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>.</p>

<p>Andrew Marvell, though unequal, is an excellent lyric
poet. His best song, <i>Where the remote Bermudas ride</i>, is
such a household word that we select a less known piece:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Ye living lamps, by whose dear light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nightingale does sit so late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And studying all the summer night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her matchless songs does meditate;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Ye country comets, that portend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No war nor prince&#8217;s funeral,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shining unto no other end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to presage the grass&#8217;s fall;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Ye glowworms, whose officious flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wandering mowers shows the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the night have lost their aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after foolish fires do stray;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Your courteous lights in vain you waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Juliana here is come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she my mind hath so displaced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I shall never find my home.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In fancy as in melody this and Marvell&#8217;s other gems
belong to the age of Charles I. Apart from Dryden, the
Restoration has little to show beside three songs of genuine
inspiration in the plays of Crowne, to be mentioned in his
place as a middling dramatist; Sir Charles Sedley&#8217;s charming
verses to Chloris; others, mostly from the same hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Motteux, and, strange to say, the Dryasdust Rymer, which
have found a harbour in Mr. Arthur Bullen&#8217;s <i>Musa
Proterva</i>; a few songs of Rochester&#8217;s and Aphra Behn&#8217;s;
some few carols in Mr. Ebsworth&#8217;s collections; and the
elegant and animated <i>To all you ladies now at land</i> of
Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset (1637-1706), less known
for his occasional verses, these excepted, than as the
arbiter of taste and the benefactor of needy men of letters.</p>

<p>It was but natural that the lyrists, like the dramatists,
should endeavour to make up in bombastic extravagance
for their deficiencies in simplicity and truth to nature. An
appropriate instrument was at hand in the Pindaric ode,
the miscreation of a true poet, Cowley. So little were the
genuine characteristics of Pindaric versification then understood
even by scholars, that it is no wonder that Cowley
should have conceived them to be equivalent to absolute
irregularity. His own compositions are not within our
province; but it may be remarked that they are distinguished
from the Pindarics of Charles II.&#8217;s time by the
preponderance of what was then called wit, which we should
describe as a perverse ingenuity in discovering superficial
resemblances between dissimilar things. It is impossible
not to admire in a measure some of the feats of this kind
performed by Cowley, Crashaw, and Donne; but common
sense intimates that the real criterion of the merit of a
comparison is its justice. The movement, nevertheless,
had considerable significance as indicating the exhaustion
of the old forms of poetry. It had triumphed in Italy and
in Spain in the persons of Marino and Gongora, with
most disastrous effects on the literature of those countries.
Fortunate it was for England that this fashion arrived late,
and before it could take much root was dislodged by the
saner methods of France. Pindarics, however, went on
existing, but with comparatively little wit, and even less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
poetry. Sprat, of whom we shall have to speak as the
historian of the Royal Society, was perhaps the most conspicuous
practitioner. The following lines on Prometheus
are a bright example of his amalgam of poetry and wit:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Along he brought the sparkling coal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From some celestial chimney<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> stole;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quickly the plundered stars he left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he hastened down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the robbed flames his hands still shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed as if they were burnt for the theft.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Congreve is equally absurd in his personification of
Sleep:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;An ancient sigh he sits upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose memory of sound is long since gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And purposely annihilated for his throne.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This poet, nevertheless, who, as pointed out by Dr. Johnson
and Mr. Gosse, has the critical merit of having given the
English Pindaric a regular structure, was capable of much
better things. The opening of the ode which yields the
above choice <i>morceau</i> (<i>To Mrs. Arabella Hunt, Singing</i>) is
in a fine strain of poetry:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Let all be hushed, each softest motion cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be every loud tumultuous thought at peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every ruder gasp of breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be calm, as in the arms of death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, most fickle, most uneasy part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou restless wanderer, my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be still; gently, ah gently, leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou busy, idle thing, to heave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stir not a pulse; and let my blood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That turbulent unruly flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be softly staid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me be all, but my attention, dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, rest, unnecessary springs of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave your officious toil and strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I would hear her voice, and try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it be possible to die.&#8217;<br /></span>

<br />
<span class="smaller">DRYDEN AND THE RESTORATION DRAMA.</span></h2>

<p>Dryden occupies an unique position as by far the most
important representative of a department of literature for
which, on his own showing, he had little natural qualification,
and in which he had little ambition to excel. Only
one of his numerous plays, he tells us, was written to please
himself. But he wanted reputation, money, and Court
favour, and these inducements directed him to the most
popular and lucrative department of the Muses&#8217; province.
Here, as elsewhere, his progress was slow. His first play,
<i>The Wild Gallant</i> (1663), has come down to us in an
amended version; in its original form it is pronounced by
Pepys &#8216;as poor a thing as I ever saw in my life.&#8217; Dryden
might long have remained an unsuccessful dramatist but
for the invention of rhyming tragedy, which, though in
itself an objectionable form, suited his talent to perfection.
The management of the heroic couplet was and always
continued the strongest of all his strong points, and his
genius for rhetoric was stimulated to the utmost by the
facilities afforded by this sonorous form of metre. Hence
<i>The Indian Emperor</i> (1665) was a great success, and determined
the main course of Dryden&#8217;s dramatic activity for
some years. It necessarily brought him nearer to the
French drama, and gave a French character to the drama
of the day, not really in harmony with the taste of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
English public, and from which Dryden ultimately freed
himself. The opinion of the day was prepared to go in the
direction of classicism as far as Jonson, but not as far as
Corneille. The French traveller Sorbire having in 1663
censured the irregularity of the English stage, was answered
by Sprat, who asserts the superiority of his countrymen,
and points out the fundamental difference in the taste of
the two nations. &#8216;The French,&#8217; he says, &#8216;for the most
part take only one or two great men, and chiefly insist
upon some one remarkable accident of their story; to this
end they admit no more persons than will serve to adorn
that: and they manage all in rhyme, with long speeches,
almost in the way of dialogues, in making high ideas of
honour, and in speaking noble things. The English on
their side make their chief plot to consist in a greater
variety of actions, and, besides the main design, add many
little contrivances. By this means their scenes are shorter,
their stage fuller, many more persons of different humours
are introduced. And in carrying on of this they generally
do only confine themselves to blank verse.&#8217; Sprat then
proceeds to point out the advantages of the English method;
and it is evident that neither he nor the public imagined
themselves to be on the eve of such serious modifications
of the national drama as actually took place&mdash;modifications
to be chiefly attributed to the taste of the Court, and the
more easily effected from the paucity of theatres.</p>

<p>The inferiority of the Restoration drama to the Elizabethan
is one of the commonplaces of criticism, perhaps
even one of its platitudes, and cannot be admitted without
some qualification. Yet, as the broad general statement
of a fact, it is undeniable, and the fact is a proof that the
elements which preserve a play as literature for posterity
are not those which fit it for the contemporary stage. In
every play of serious purpose there is, or should be, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
earthly part and a spiritual, dramatic craftsmanship and
poetical inspiration. In the former particular the Restoration
dramatists compare not unfavourably with their predecessors,
always excepting Shakespeare; they fail not as
dramatists, but as poets. The whole Elizabethan drama
is steeped in an atmosphere of poetry. To say nothing of
its chief representatives, take up such satires as <i>The Return
from Parnassus</i>, or such merely occasional pieces as the
academical play on <i>Timon</i> which preceded Shakespeare&#8217;s,
and you will not doubt that you are reading the work of a
poet. Read through, on the other hand, the best plays of
the representative dramatists of the Restoration, and you
will generally find the poetical element concentrated in a few
brilliant passages. In the Elizabethan age, it is evident,
men lived at such a height of heroic and romantic sentiment
that the purveyors of public entertainment could not
but be poets. In the Restoration era, on the other hand,
men habitually lived, breathed, and wrote prose; and when
the dramatist would be a poet, he had to set himself to
the task. To convince ourselves that the distinction between
poetry and prose is not artificial, as Carlyle seemed
to think, but essential, we have only to consider the widely
different influence of Elizabethan and Restoration drama
upon the after world. Both, excepting the works of Shakespeare,
are virtually dead as acted drama. But in losing
the stage the Restoration drama has lost everything, while
the Elizabethan is yet a living and working force. It
powerfully co-operated in the splendid revival of English
poetry at the end of last century; it is at this moment an
inspirer and a nurse of young genius. It is inconceivable
that the Restoration drama as a whole should inspire anyone,
or that it should count for anything as a factor in
future developments of literature. One is a perennial
plant, which may die down to the root in ungenial seasons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
but will assuredly put forth new flowers; the other is a
fossil, curious and in some measure beautiful, but devoid
of vital force. And for this, the merely intellectual merits
of both being so considerable, no reason can be given but
that one is on the whole poetical, and therefore living, the
other on the whole prosaic, and therefore inert. Hence
we may prophesy of the success of the endeavour of Ibsen,
and other men of distinguished talent, to produce dramas
conceived in an entirely realistic spirit, and entirely devoted
to the problems of modern society. Such competitions
will be valuable <i>pices justificatives</i> for the intellectual
history of the nineteenth century, but they will be extinct
as literary forces long ere the end of the twentieth.</p>

<p>This, nevertheless, is to be said for the Restoration
dramatists, that their art is not an imitation of an extinct
form of the drama, but is at least something new, really
expressive of the sentiments of their generation. The
imitation of Shakespeare could only have produced gross
unreality, which must have degenerated still further into
mere inanity. The playwrights did what the contemporary
painters should have done, they fell back, in a measure,
upon realism when high imagination was no longer possible.
If they had gone further in this direction their works would
have possessed more intrinsic merit, and have claimed a
more important place in the history of culture. Their
tragedies would not so often have been rendered unnatural
by the employment of rhyme, and their comedies would
have exhibited the manners and the morals of the English
nation, and not merely of the playgoing part of it. It
cannot be believed that the comedy of that age affords anything
like so faithful a picture of the seventeenth century
as Fielding&#8217;s novels do of the eighteenth. The realistic
tendency was chiefly conspicuous in the closer approach to
the language of common life, and in the more logical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
character even of appeals to emotion. The extravagant
transports of heroes and heroines only betray that true
imagination had grown cold; but the manly nervous
sense and the almost forensic reasoning so often found in
their company show that a new stratum had really been
touched.</p>

<p>Another consideration should not be overlooked in the
comparison between the Elizabethan and the Restoration
drama, that the debasement of the latter is exaggerated
from the seeming abruptness of the metamorphosis undergone
by the former. Passing from the stage of Shakespeare
to the stage of Dryden, we appear to have suddenly
entered a new world. The representatives of the drama
seem instantaneously transformed by some Circean potion
into beings of a lower type. We do not immediately
remember that the gradual development which would have
interpreted the apparent prodigy was rudely interrupted
by the Civil War and the Commonwealth. If the interval
between Shirley and Dryden had been continuously occupied
by popular dramatists, we should have observed the
change slowly coming on, and have watched the older form
shading off into the newer by gradations not more violent
than those by which the latter subsequently passed into
the drama of the eighteenth century. As it is, the poets
of Charles II.&#8217;s time seem the authors of a revolution of
which they were merely the instruments. The younger
portion of their audiences, on whose suffrages they had
mainly to rely, had scarcely so much as seen a play. The
spells of authority and tradition were broken, or at least
so grievously impaired as to be unable to withstand the
seduction of French example. Honest Samuel Pepys
would not have so easily pronounced the <i>Midsummer
Night&#8217;s Dream</i> &#8216;a mean thing&#8217; if the romantic drama had
not been absolutely extinct for him. And, taking a broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
view of the revolution in popular taste, we must admit
that, however deplorable in itself, it had some good sides.
It tended to bring England more into harmony with the
general current of European taste and thought, and repressed
the tendency of our noble literature to fanciful
and eccentric insularity. In the long run, moreover, it was
serviceable to the English drama by providing a substitute,
however inferior, for the old vein now unproductive. The
want of such a resource killed the drama of Spain.
Spanish dramatists, until the nineteenth century, were
unable to accommodate themselves to any dramatic form
but the national one, every phase of which had been completely
exemplified before the end of the seventeenth
century. In consequence, the Spanish theatre of the
eighteenth century did not produce a single tolerable piece
until, near the termination of the epoch, a playwright
arose who was capable of profiting by French example.</p>

<p>Another extenuation of the departure of the Restoration
dramatists from the better traditions of the English stage
is the strength as well as the suddenness of the new influence
to which they were subjected. It came from the
Court, and the Court dispensed the playwright&#8217;s daily
bread. There is sufficient evidence that even Shakespeare
was by no means indifferent to the good opinion of Elizabeth
and James, but neither of these sovereigns was sufficiently
the drama&#8217;s patron to be the drama&#8217;s legislator. It
was otherwise with Charles II., a man of wit, taste, and
polish, inaccessible to the deeper emotions of humanity,
and without a grain of poetry in his composition. Such a
man must have found the Elizabethan drama intolerable.
He no doubt honestly agreed with his laureate, who coolly
says: &#8216;At his return he found a nation lost as much in
barbarism as in rebellion; and, as the excellency of his
nature forgave the one, so the excellency of his manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
reformed the other. The desire of imitating so great a
pattern first awakened the dull and heavy spirits of the
English from their natural reservedness.&#8217; With every
allowance for adulation, there can be no doubt that Dryden
in a considerable measure believed himself a reformer.
Charles had his Paladins in the field of letters. &#8216;The
favour,&#8217; says Dryden elsewhere, &#8216;which heroic plays have
lately found upon our theatres has been wholly derived to
them from the countenance and approbation they have received
at Court.&#8217; We may well feel thankful that the experiment
of Gallicizing the native genius of England
should have been tried so fairly, and have broken down so
utterly, under such patronage as Charles&#8217;s and in such
hands as Dryden&#8217;s. We have not quite seen the last of it,
but where Corneille and Molire failed Goncourt and Zola
are not likely to succeed.</p>

<p>This may at least be said for Dryden, that the romantic
drama was for a time in a state of suspended animation,
and that the only question was what successor should fill
its place. For a short time two foreign schools seemed contending
for the prize. Dryden&#8217;s own allegiance in his first
piece, <i>The Wild Gallant</i>, was given to the Spanish drama,
a form exceedingly attractive from its brisk action, sudden
vicissitudes, and dexterous development of intrigue. But
the Spanish drama cannot be naturalized in England for
two reasons, one creditable to English genius, the other
the reverse. A play of intrigue is necessarily a play of
incident, and allows little room for the development of
character; but Englishmen are &#8216;humoursome,&#8217; and enjoy
the discrimination of character to the nicest shades. If
we judged the two nations solely by their dramas, we
should say that all Spaniards were exactly alike, and no
two Englishmen. The other reason is that Englishmen do
not particularly excel in the contrivance of incident, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
that few even of our best dramatists could rival the ingenuity
of third-rate Spanish playwrights. The Anglo-Spanish
drama soon disappeared, and its place in serious
dramatic literature was taken by a <i>genre</i> most intimately
associated with the name of Dryden, its most brilliant
practitioner, and upon whose desertion it crumbled into
dust.</p>

<p>Dryden himself has told us in few words what he understands
by an heroic play, and the definition exempts him
from much of the criticism to which he might otherwise
have been held liable: &#8216;An heroic play ought to be an
imitation, in little, of an heroic poem.&#8217; In other words, it
must have an epical element as well as a dramatic. The
experiment was worth making, as it proved that neither
branch of the poetic art gained anything by invading the
other&#8217;s territory. Compared with the art of Shakespeare
or of Sophocles, the art of Dryden in this department
seems a tawdry caricature. All the higher qualities of
the dramatist are absent, being, in fact, inconsistent with
the demands of epic poetry, while epic dignity is equally
sacrificed to the exigencies of drama. Without constant
hurry and bustle, such pieces would be intolerable. They
require, as Dryden tacitly admits by the quotation from
Ariosto, which he adduces as expressive of his guiding
principle, a constant succession of adventures. Such incessant
agitation leaves no place for the development of
character; the actors come on the stage ready labelled; or
if, like Nourmahal in <i>Aurengzebe</i>, they disclose a new trait,
the sudden novelty produces the effect of complete metamorphosis.
The pieces could only be regarded as splendid
puppet-shows, were not the failings of the dramatist so
frequently redeemed by the poet. It so chanced that the
Coryphus of this unnatural style was the most splendid
poetical declaimer (unless Byron be excepted) that England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
ever produced, and his pieces resound with tirades not
merely brilliant in diction and sonorous in versification,
but now fiery with mettlesome spirit, now weighty with
manly sense. And these qualities were aided by the otherwise
objectionable form selected by the poet. His blank-verse
plays, far superior as works of art, contain few such
eloquent passages as his rhyming tragedies. Rhyme
helped him on, as a riderless runaway horse is spurred by
the thunder of his own hoofs. Even where his thought is
poor, its poverty is veiled by the brilliancy of the diction&mdash;a
brilliancy which he could hardly have attained by the use of
any other form; and if the employment of rhyme seems,
as it is, unnatural, the form at least harmonizes with the
substance, and they produce between them an illusive
effect of a species of art which may possibly be legitimate,
as the ordinary rules evidently do not apply. We must
also remember how this subornation of the judgment, not
imperceptible or ineffective in the closet, was aided on the
stage by the most potent appeals to the senses.</p>

<p><i>Tyrannic Love</i>, Dryden&#8217;s first considerable attempt in
&#8216;heroic tragedy,&#8217; is very remarkable as a proof of to what
extraordinary absurdities a vigorous intellect may be liable,
and also how these may be dignified by energy of expression.
&#8216;The rants of Maximin,&#8217; says Johnson, &#8216;have long been the
sport of criticism;&#8217; but so spirited and sonorous is the
diction, that, inconsistent as seems the alliance of admiration
with derision, such actually is the mingled feeling which they
excite in the quiet of the closet. On the stage they must
have passed off much better by the aid of scenery, costume,
and emphatic declamation; and success on the boards, it
must be remembered, was invariably Dryden&#8217;s first object.
The same consideration which explains, though it does not
excuse, his indecency, palliates his bombast. He wrote to
live, and could not afford to produce unactable dramas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
A much more interesting performance than <i>Tyrannic Love</i>
is his <i>Conquest of Granada</i> (1669-1670). It is a touchstone
of &#8216;heroic tragedy,&#8217; a crucial test of what it can and what
it cannot do. It renounces all pretence to nature, reason,
and probability; on the other hand, it delights with a
crowd of striking sentiments and images, and enchains the
attention with perpetual bustle and variety. It is to one
of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays as a bit of shining glass is to a
plant of which every fibre is the creation of a natural law.
Yet the glass is not a displeasing object, neither is the
play.</p>

<p>The worst offence of <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>, after all, is
not its bombast, but its bathos. It is true that both spring
from the same root, that want of genuine creative imagination
which in attempting the great only achieves the big,
which a small oversight easily converts into the laughable.
But apart from this failing, which Dryden shares with
most epic poets of the second rank, it is difficult to acquit
him of a singular insensibility to the ridiculous. This is
evinced among other things by the entire conception of one
of his most serious and elaborate works, <i>The Hind and the
Panther</i>, and it requires all the gravity and obvious conviction
of his preface to <i>The Conquest of Granada</i> to convince
us that he did not occasionally mean to burlesque his
own principles. The rapid changes of fortune, the constant
fallings into and out of love, the odd predicaments in
which heroes and heroines continually find themselves, frequently
produce the effect of the broadest comedy&mdash;an effect
much assisted by the extraordinary rants of the principal
speakers; as when Lyndaraxa desires the personage who
has first stabbed her and then himself to</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Die for us both, I have not leisure now;&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>or Almahide threatens to send her ghost to fetch back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Almanzor&#8217;s scarf, as if she and her ghost were different
beings; or Almanzor&#8217;s astounding menace to his mother&#8217;s
spirit:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;I&#8217;ll squeeze thee like a bladder there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make thee groan thyself away in air.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>So unequal is Dryden&#8217;s genius that the second of these
monstrosities occurs in close proximity to the exquisite
verses:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&#8216;What precious drops are those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which silently each other&#8217;s track pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright as young diamonds in their infant dew?&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and the burlesque threat to the ghost is immediately succeeded
by the noble couplet:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;I am the ghost of her who gave thee birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The airy shadow of her mouldering earth.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The beauties which are thickly sown throughout <i>The
Conquest of Granada</i> owe, perhaps, something of their
effect as poetry to the utter want of nature in the characters
and of reason in the conduct of the play. In a drama
aiming at the delineation of real men and women they
would frequently have appeared absurdly inappropriate,
but when it is once understood that the personages are
the puppets and mouthpieces of the author, the question of
dramatic propriety becomes irrelevant. Yet <i>The Conquest
of Granada</i> is something more than a heap of glittering
morsels of sentiment and wit. It possesses a unity of
feeling which serves as cement for these scattered jewels.
The &#8216;kind of generous and noble spirit animating it,&#8217; to
employ Mr. Saintsbury&#8217;s just description, maintains the
reader at a level above the pitch of ordinary life. When
he opens the book he rises, as he closes it he descends.
He may laugh, but his amusement is unmingled with con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>tempt;
and ever and anon he comes upon the genuine
heroic, unsuspected of sham, unspoiled by bombast. The
soul of chivalry inspires the lines quoted with just applause
by both Scott and Saintsbury:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&#8216;Fair though you are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As summer mornings, and your eyes more bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than stars that twinkle on a winter&#8217;s night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though you have eloquence to warm and move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cold age and fasting hermits into love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Almahide with scorn rewards my care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet than to change &#8217;tis nobler to despair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love&#8217;s my soul, and that from fate is free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis that unchanged and deathless part of me.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>Aurengzebe</i> (1675), Mr. Saintsbury considers &#8216;in some
respects a very noble play.&#8217; We should rather have called
it an indifferent play with some noble passages more remarkable
for eloquence than dramatic propriety. The characters,
though by no means subtle or even natural, are
better discriminated than in <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>;
there is much less rant and bustle, yet quite enough to
make one cordially echo Indamora&#8217;s nave inquiry:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Are there yet more Morats, more fighting kings?&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nor are choice examples of bathos wanting. Aurengzebe
finely says:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;I need not haste the end of life to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The precipice is just beneath my feet.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nourmahal replies:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Think not my sense of virtue is so small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll rather leap down first and break your fall.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The first act opens with a striking couplet:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;The night seems doubled with the fear she brings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o&#8217;er the citadel now spreads her wings.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>To which immediately succeeds:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;The morning, as mistaken, turns about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all her early fires again go out.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Dryden was probably betrayed into these lapses, not so
much by mere haste and carelessness, as by the trick of the
heroic metre, which in dialogue almost enforces balanced
antithesis.</p>

<p>Nearly all <i>Aurengzebe</i> is composed in this brilliant snip-snap,
where the ball of a fine sentiment, tossed from one
character to another, comes back in a retort, to be returned
in a repartee. Of dramatic art as Shakespeare or the
Greeks understood it there is not a trace; the pivot of the
action is the property, fitter for a fairy tale than a tragedy,
possessed by Indamora, of compelling every one who sees
her to fall in love with her. Neither pity nor terror can be
excited on such terms; if Aristotle&#8217;s criterion be sound,
<i>Aurengzebe</i> is no tragedy at all. If, however, we are content
to regard it as a medley of fine things, a model of
spirited declamation and sonorous versification, it claims
high praise. Great must have been the intellectual strength
which could thus thunder and dazzle through five acts of
unabated energy: and the sentiments, considered merely
as such, lose nothing of their effect from being placed in
the mouths of puppets, and misplaced even there. Take,
for instance, the most famous passage in the play, one of
the finest in all Dryden:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;When I consider life, &#8217;tis all a cheat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, fooled with hope, men favour the deceit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trust on, and think to-morrow will repay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow&#8217;s falser than the former day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies worse, and while it says, we shall be blest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some new joys, cuts off what we possest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange cozenage! None would live past years again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the dregs of life think to receive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What the first sprightly runnings could not give.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This potent quintessence of the experience of age is ill
assigned to Aurengzebe, a young prince at the outset of a
splendid career; but the word remains while the lip is
forgotten, and has taken its place among the treasures of
English poetry. Among other claims to notice, <i>Aurengzebe</i>
is remarkable as one of the few English dramas in which
a living foreign potentate is brought upon the stage, and,
less exceptionally, for its entire perversion of the truth of
history. The generous and filial part here ascribed to the
unnatural and cold-blooded Aurengzebe was really performed
by his unfortunate brother Dara. To have crowned
Dara, however, would have involved an equal violation of
historical truth, to have killed him a violation of what the
dramatists of Dryden&#8217;s day considered more important,
poetical justice.</p>

<p><i>Marriage  la Mode</i> (1673), the first fair example of
Dryden&#8217;s comedy, is a more satisfactory exhibition of his
power as a dramatist, if a piece adding little to his fame
as a poet. Mr. Saintsbury justly remarks that &#8216;Scott&#8217;s
general undervaluing of Dryden&#8217;s comic pieces is very
evident&#8217; in his prefatory notice. Mr. Saintsbury himself,
though warmly appreciative of &#8216;Dryden&#8217;s only original
excursion into the realms of the higher comedy,&#8217; might, we
think, have said even more in its favour. The situation of
the spouses, fancying themselves tired of each other while
their affection only needs the fillip of jealousy, is comic in
a high degree, and the brisk intricacy of the action, with
only four actors to sustain it, manifests great ingenuity and
deftness in dramatic construction. The serious section of
the play is certainly much less meritorious than the comic,
to which it is a mere appendage. Written in most slovenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
blank verse, it entirely wants the fire and energy of Dryden&#8217;s
heroic plays. Its fault is rather sterility than extravagance;
with some exceptions, it appears tame and bald. But these
exceptions are very fine. The scene between Leonidas and
Palmyra (act ii., sc. 1) is like a morsel of Theocritus,
allying the charm of pastoral innocence to the wit and
point of an accomplished court-poet. It is remarkable
how surely, at this period of his career, Dryden rises when
he resorts to rhyme; but even the careless blank verse of
this play, in general merely a foil to the comic part, sometimes
sparkles with strokes worthy of a great poet:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;<i>Pol.</i> He is a prince, and you are meanly born.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Leon.</i> Love either finds equality, or makes it.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&#8216;For this glory, after I have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The canopy of state spread wide above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the abyss of heaven, the court of stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blushing morning, and the rising sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What greater can I see?&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&mdash;a thought borrowed from Menander.</p>

<p>Continuing our survey of Dryden&#8217;s plays, rather according
to subject than to chronological order, we arrive at the
tragi-comedy of <i>The Spanish Friar</i> (1681), one of the
most esteemed of his lighter pieces, but whose praise, we
must agree with Mr. Saintsbury, has outstripped its
desert. The comic portion is certainly very drastic, but it
is not comedy of a high order. It exhibits a distinct
declension from <i>Marriage  la Mode</i>, where the quartette
of <i>Mitschuldiger</i> are well individualized personages. The
sinners in <i>The Spanish Friar</i> are of the most ordinary type&mdash;a
stage rake, a stage coquette, a stage miser, and a stage
friar. Dominick is, indeed, exceedingly amusing, but is more
farcical than truly comic. He is painted in broad, staring
colours, without delicacy of gradation, with the same brush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
as the author&#8217;s Morats and Almanzors, only dipped into a
different paint. Like so many of Dryden&#8217;s personages, he
is better adapted for the stage than the closet. Every
word and gesture would tell in the hands of a good actor,
and in Dryden&#8217;s time the stage was richer in first-class
performers than it ever was before, and probably than it
has ever been since. Dryden himself, it must be recorded,
attached a high value to his piece, and Dryden was an
excellent critic of himself as well as of others. The merit
on which he lays chief stress, however, is the ingenious
blending of the tragic and comic action. &#8216;The tragic part,&#8217;
says Mr. Churton Collins, &#8216;helps out the comic, and the
comic relieves naturally and appropriately the tragic. In
this work, tragi-comedy, from an artistic point of view,
has achieved perhaps its highest success.&#8217; This, however,
is the achievement of a playwright; in one passage
alone do we find the poet. It is the highly imaginative
series of descriptions of the distant noises from the
Moorish camp, boding assault to the beleaguered city, of
the panic in the city itself, and of the far-off, uncertain
battle:</p>

<p>The next play of Dryden&#8217;s which it is necessary to
notice here might have ranked among his masterpieces if
it had been entirely or even principally his own. It is
sufficient praise for him to have followed Plautus and
Molire with no unequal steps, and while borrowing, as he
could not help, the substance of his piece from them, to
have enriched their groundwork with original conceptions
of his own. The plot of <i>Amphitryon</i> may be considered
common property. A better subject for the comic theatre
cannot be conceived than the equivocations occasioned by
Jupiter&#8217;s assumption of Amphitryon&#8217;s appearance, doubled,
and, as it were, parodied over again by the comic poet&#8217;s
happy thought of introducing Mercury in the disguise of
Amphitryon&#8217;s valet. It is surprising that the theme
should not have attracted the best poets of the Athenian
Middle Comedy. So far as we know, however, it was only
treated by a single author, and he not one of the highest
reputation, Archippus. How far Plautus translated
Archippus must remain a question, but considering that
the Greek play attained no especial reputation, while the
Latin is one of the best we have, it is only fair to give
Plautus credit for having introduced a good deal of his
own. His comedy has unfortunately reached us in a mutilated
condition, wanting, probably, not less than three
hundred verses in the fourth act, but enough remains
to show how the action was conducted. Molire, the
greatest of comic poets, could not fail to improve upon
his model. The substance of the piece admitted of no
material alteration, but Molire has greatly enriched and
embellished it&mdash;first by the happy idea of the prologue
between Mercury and Night, for which, however, he is as
much indebted to Lucian as he is to Plautus for the rest&mdash;and
even more by the amusing scene between Sosia and
Cleanthis. His play, unlike most of his other performances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
is written in a lyrical metre, and the language is a model
of elegance, harmony, and polish. Dryden, writing in
prose or negligent blank verse, could not rival Molire in
this respect; but while losing nothing of the <i>vis comica</i> of
either of his predecessors, he has heightened the humour
of the piece by a still further elaboration of the hints
given by Molire. He was himself well acquainted with
Lucian, from whom he has borrowed several additional
strokes; and he has doubled the entertainment of the
situation between Sosia and Cleanthis by the creation of
Phdra, whose intrigue with Mercury makes the comedy
of errors absolutely complete.</p>

<p>We have now to consider the two plays of Dryden&#8217;s on
which his fame as a dramatist principally rests, and which,
if in some respects less interesting than his other dramatic
writings, as less intensely characteristic of the man and his
age, are for that very reason better equipped for competition
for a place among the dramas of all time.</p>

<p><i>All for Love</i> (1678) is, Dryden tells us, the only play he
wrote entirely to please his own taste, and composed professedly
in imitation of &#8216;the divine Shakespeare.&#8217; He did
not, as in his unfortunate alteration of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>,
select a piece of Shakespeare&#8217;s which, not understanding,
he rashly thought himself able to improve, but, in a spirit
of true reverence, set himself to copy one which he held in
high esteem. It should be remembered, to the honour of
Dryden&#8217;s critical judgment, that the two plays of Shakespeare&#8217;s
most warmly commended by him, <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i> and <i>Richard the Second</i>, were generally underrated
even by Shakespeare&#8217;s most devoted worshippers,
until Coleridge taught us better. In <i>All for Love</i> he
found a subject suitable to his genius, and, in our opinion,
achieved very decidedly his best play. It is, indeed, almost
as good as a play on the French model can be, inferior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
its prototypes only from the lack of brilliant declamation,
scarcely practicable without rhyme, but more than compensating
this inferiority by the greater freedom and
flexibility of its blank verse. Its defects are mainly those
of its species, and would be less apparent if it did not so
directly court comparison with one of the greatest examples
of Shakespeare&#8217;s art. It would have been impossible for
a greater genius than Dryden to have done justice to his
theme within the confines prescribed by the classical drama.
The demeanour of Antony during the period of his downfall,
as recorded by history, is below the dignity of tragedy.
Some weakness may be forgiven in a hero, but the heroism
of the real Antony is swallowed up in weakness. We can
but pity, and pity is largely leavened with contempt.
There is but one remedy, to create a Cleopatra so wondrous
and fascinating as fairly to counterbalance the empire
which Antony throws away for her sake. Shakespeare&#8217;s
art is equal to the occasion; his Cleopatra is dmonic, and
at the same time so intensely feminine that the purest and
meekest of her sex may see much of themselves in her.
She is at once an epitome and an encyclopdia, and the
reader can hardly despise Antony for being the slave of a
spell which he feels so strongly himself. Dryden&#8217;s Cleopatra
wants this character of universality, which, indeed,
none but Shakespeare could have given, and Shakespeare
himself could not have given if in bondage to the unities.
She is a fine, passionate, sensuous woman, a kind of Mary
Stuart, interesting, but not to the point at which it could
be felt that the world were well lost for her. The inferiority
of Cleopatra reacts grievously upon Antony. Shakespeare&#8217;s
Cleopatra is so grand that her lover is exalted by the
admiration which, in spite of her perfidies, she manifestly
feels for him. The beloved of such a woman must be
heroic, an impression skilfully assisted by the effect Antony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
produces upon the prudent and politic Augustus. Dryden&#8217;s
Cleopatra can bestow no such patent of distinction. By
so much as the chief personages are inferior to their exemplars,
by so much also is the puny, starved action of
Dryden&#8217;s tragedy, restricted to one day and seven characters,
inferior to the opulence of Shakespeare&#8217;s, ranging
over the Roman world, crowded with personages, and
gathering up every trait from Plutarch that could contribute
picturesqueness to its prodigality of incident and
sentiment. Nor is Dryden entirely successful in the conduct
of his plot. The introduction of Octavia is a happy
idea, but she appears at too late a period of Antony&#8217;s
history. The implication that his return to her could
have availed him in so desperate an extremity is more
contrary to historical truth and common reason than any
of the anachronisms for which Dryden derides Elizabethan
poets. The intrigue by which Dolabella is made to excite
Antony&#8217;s jealousy is more worthy of comedy than of heroic
tragedy, besides being inconsistent with the manly character
of its promoter, Ventidius. This gallant veteran is
indeed a fine creation; too fine, for he sometimes seems to
eclipse Antony and Cleopatra both, and assumes more
prominence in the action than Shakespeare would have
allowed him. Alexas is the hasty and much marred outline
of a character which might have been hardly less
impressive had Dryden been at the pains to work out the
conception adumbrated in the first act. When all these
imperfections are admitted, and they should not be passed
over in silence after Scott&#8217;s ill-judged parallel of Dryden&#8217;s
performance with Shakespeare&#8217;s, it remains true that <i>All
for Love</i> is a very fine play, energetic, passionate, and
steeped in that atmosphere of nobility which half redeems
the literary defects of <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>. The
poetry is frequently very fine, as in Octavia&#8217;s speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to Antony, remarkable as perhaps the sole instance of
genuine pathos throughout the entire range of Dryden&#8217;s
dramatic writings:</p>

<p><i>Don Sebastian</i> (1690) is generally regarded as Dryden&#8217;s
dramatic masterpiece. It did not please upon its first
appearance, owing to its excessive length. Dryden ingenuously
confesses that he was obliged to sacrifice twelve
hundred lines, which he restored when the play was printed.
Mr. Saintsbury more than hints a preference for <i>All for
Love</i>, which we entirely share. Were even the serious part
of the respective dramas of equal merit, the scale would be
turned in favour of <i>All for Love</i> by the wretchedness of the
comic scenes which constitute so large a portion of the rival
drama. They are at best indifferent farce, and cannot be
even called excrescences on the main action, inasmuch as
they do not grow out of it at all. In unity of action, therefore,
and uniformity of literary merit, <i>All for Love</i> excels
its competitor, and its personages are more truthful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
more interesting. Sebastian, though a gallant, chivalrous
figure, takes no such hold on the imagination as Antony
and Ventidius; and Almeyda, one of the least interesting
of Dryden&#8217;s heroines, is a sorry exchange for Cleopatra.
Muley Moloch and Benducar are wholly stagey. Nothing,
then, remains but Dorax, and his capabilities are chiefly
evinced in one great scene. Even this is in some respects
inartificially conducted. The spectator is insufficiently prepared
for it. The special ground of Dorax&#8217;s resentment
comes upon us as a surprise; and his repentance is too
hasty and sudden. A similar defect may be alleged against
the whole of the tragic action. The centre of interest is
gradually shifted, not intentionally, but from the author&#8217;s
omission to foreshadow the events to come after the fashion
of a masterpiece he must have studied, the <i>&OElig;dipus
Tyrannus</i>. At first all our interest is enlisted for Sebastian&#8217;s
life, and it is with a sort of puzzlement that we feel ourselves
at last listening to a story of incest. Muley Moloch
and Benducar have disappeared, and their place is occupied
by a new character, Alvarez. In every respect, therefore,
regarded as a work of art, <i>Don Sebastian</i> fails to sustain
comparison with <i>All for Love</i>, and there is no countervailing
superiority in the diction, whose general nobility and spirit
occasionally swell into bombast. The worst fault remains
to be told: Dorax&#8217;s ludicrous escape from death by reason
of being poisoned by two enemies at once. If either the
Emperor or the Mufti would have let him alone he would
never have lived to be reconciled to Sebastian, but the fiery
drug of the one is neutralized by the icy bane of the other, and
<i>vice vers</i>. Dryden thinks it sufficient excuse that a similar
incident is vouched for by Ausonius, but really there is
nothing so farcical in the <i>Rehearsal</i>. On the whole, we
cannot but consider <i>Don Sebastian</i> a very imperfect play,
redeemed from mediocrity by the general vigour and anima<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>tion
of the diction, and the loftiness of soul which seldom
forsakes Dryden, except when he wilfully panders to the
popular taste.</p>

<p>But little space can here be devoted to Dryden&#8217;s other
plays. Some are not worth criticism. <i>The Mock Astrologer</i>,
largely borrowed from French and Spanish sources, contains
some of his best lyrics. Many parts of <i>Cleomenes</i>
are very noble, but it is somewhat heavy as a whole. <i>King
Arthur</i>, a musical and spectacular drama, is an excellent
specimen of its class. Dryden&#8217;s portion of <i>&OElig;dipus</i>, written
in conjunction with Lee, shows how finely he, like his
model Lucan, could deal with the supernatural. This
is by no means the case with his <i>State of Innocence and
Fall of Man</i>, which is, nevertheless, one of his pieces most
worthy of perusal. It measures the prodigious fall from
the age of Cromwell to the age of Charles; while Dryden
yet displays such fine poetical gifts as to command respect
amid all the absurdities of his unintentional burlesque of
Milton.</p>

<p>Dryden undeniably took up the profession of playwright
without an effectual call. He became a dramatist, as clever
men in our day become journalists, discerning in the
stage the shortest literary cut to fame and fortune. He
can hardly be said to have possessed any strictly dramatic
gift in any exceptional degree, but he had enough of all to
make a tolerable figure on the stage, and was besides a
great poet and an admirable critic. His poetry redeems
the defects of his serious plays, if we except such a mere
<i>pice de circonstance</i> as <i>Amboyna</i>. The best of them have
very bad faults, but even the worst are impressed with the
stamp of genius. It is only in comedy that his failure is
sometimes utter and irretrievable; yet a perception of the
humorous cannot be denied to the author of <i>Amphitryon</i>.
But we nowhere find evidence of any supreme dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
faculty, anything that would have constrained him to write
plays if plays had not happened to be in fashion. As he
was not born a dramatic poet he had to be made one, and he
became one mainly in virtue of his eminent critical endowment.
His prefaces are a most interesting study. They
exhibit the steady advance of a slow, strong, sure mind from
rudimentary conceptions to as just views of the requisites
of dramatic poetry as could well be attained in an age encumbered
with venerable fallacies. Dryden&#8217;s manly sense,
homely sagacity, and piercing shrewdness, break through
many trammels, as when, in the preface to <i>All for Love</i>,
he vindicates his breach of the conventions of the French
stage. In that to <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> he compares Shakespeare
with Fletcher, and pronounces decidedly in favour
of the former, a preference far from universal in his day. The
preface to <i>The Spanish Friar</i> is the most remarkable of any,
and shows how much he had learned and unlearned. We
shall, nevertheless, find his special glory in his character as
the most truly representative dramatist of his time. Otway
might have been an Elizabethan, Dryden never could. If
we seek for the dramatic author to whom he is on the
whole nearest of kin, we may perhaps find him in Byron.
Byron had no more genuine dramatic vocation than Dryden
had, but, like Dryden, produced memorable works by
force and flexibility of genius. From the theatrical point
of view Dryden&#8217;s plays are greatly superior to Byron&#8217;s; if
the latter&#8217;s rank higher as literature the main cause is the
existence of more favourable conditions. Dryden&#8217;s worst
faults would have been impossible in the nineteenth century;
and his treatment of the supernatural, his frequent visitations
of speculation, and the lofty tone of his heroic passages,
prove that he could have drawn a Manfred, a Cain, or a
Myrrha, if he had lived like Byron in a renovated age.</p>

<br />
<span class="smaller">DRAMATIC POETS AND PLAYWRIGHTS.</span></h2>

<p>After Dryden, the metrical dramatists of the Restoration,
as of other epochs, may be accurately divided into
two classes, the poets and the playwrights. As was to be
expected in an age when even genuine poetry drooped
earthward, and prose seldom kindled into poetry, the latter
class was largely in the majority. Only three dramatists
can justly challenge the title of poet&mdash;Dryden, Otway, and
Lee. In Dryden a mighty fire, half choked with its own
fuel, struggles gallantly against extinction, and eventually
evolves nearly as much flame as smoke. In Otway a pure
and delicate flame hovers fitfully over a morass; in Lee
the smothered fire breaks out, as Pope said of Lucan and
Statius, &#8216;in sudden, brief, and interrupted flashes.&#8217; Dryden
was incomparably the most vigorous of the three, but
Otway was the only born dramatist, and the little of
genuine dramatic excellence that he has wrought claims a
higher place than the more dazzling productions of his
contemporary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Otway
(1651-1685).</div>

<p>Thomas Otway, son of the vicar of Woolbeding, was
born at Trotton, near Midhurst, in Sussex,
March 3rd, 1651. He was educated at Winchester
and Christchurch, but (perhaps driven
by necessity, for he says in the dedication to <i>Venice Preserved</i>,
&#8216;A steady faith, and loyalty to my prince was all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the inheritance my father left me&#8217;) forsook the latter ere
his academical course was half completed to try his fortune
as a performer on the stage, where he entirely failed. His
first play, <i>Alcibiades</i> (1675), a poor piece, served to introduce
him to Rochester and other patrons; and in the following year
<i>Don Carlos</i>, founded upon the novel by Saint Ral, obtained,
partly by the support of Rochester, with whom Otway soon
quarrelled, a striking success, and is said to have produced
more than any previous play. Two translations from the
French followed; next (1678) came the unsuccessful comedy
of <i>Friendship in Fashion</i>, and in 1680 <i>Caius Marius</i>, an
audacious plagiarism from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. In the interim
Otway had made trial of a military career, but the
regiment in which he had obtained a commission was
speedily disbanded, his pay was withheld, and he had to
support himself by plundering Shakespeare. In the same
year in which he had stooped so low he proved his
superiority to all contemporary dramatists by his tragedy
of <i>The Orphan</i>, in which he first displayed the pathos by
which he has merited the character of the English Euripides.
Johnson remarks that Otway &#8216;conceived forcibly,
and drew originally, by consulting nature in his own breast;&#8217;
and it is known that he experienced the pangs of a seven years&#8217;
unrequited passion for the beautiful actress, Mrs. Barry. In
1681 he produced <i>The Soldier&#8217;s Fortune</i>, a comedy chiefly
interesting for its allusions to his own military experiences.
According to Downes, its success was extraordinary, and
brought both profit and reputation to the theatre. If it
brought any of the former to the author, this must have been
soon exhausted, since in the dedication to <i>Venice Preserved</i>
(1682) he speaks of himself as only rescued from the direst
want by the generosity of the Duchess of Portsmouth. For
this great play, as well as for <i>The Orphan</i>, he is said to have
received a hundred pounds. <i>The Atheist</i>, a second part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<i>The Soldier&#8217;s Fortune</i> (1684), was probably unproductive;
and in April, 1685, Otway died on Tower Hill, undoubtedly
in distress, although, of the two accounts of his death, that
which ascribes it to a fever caught in pursuing an assassin,
is better authenticated than the more usual one which represents
him as choked by a loaf which he was devouring
in a state of ravenous hunger. Such a story, nevertheless,
could not have obtained credit if his circumstances had not
been known to have been desperate. It is not likely that
he had much conduct or economy in his affairs, or was
endowed in any degree with the severer virtues. The tone
of his letters to Mrs. Barry, however, and the constancy of
his seven years&#8217; affection for her, seem to indicate a natural
refinement of feeling, and if there is truth in the dictum,</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;He best can paint them, who can feel them most,&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>the creator of Monimia and Belvidera must have been
endowed with a heart tender in no common degree. &#8216;He
was,&#8217; we are told, &#8216;of middle size, inclinable to corpulency,
had thoughtful, yet lively, and as it were speaking eyes.&#8217;</p>

<p>Otway&#8217;s reputation rests entirely on his two great performances,
<i>The Orphan</i> and <i>Venice Preserved</i>. His other
plays deserve no special notice, although <i>Don Carlos</i>, which
is said to have for many years attracted larger audiences
than either of his masterpieces, might have been a good
play if it had not been written in rhyme. The action is
highly dramatic, and the characters, though artless, are
not ineffective; but the pathos in which the poet excelled
is continually disturbed by the bombastic couplets, ever
trembling on the brink of the ridiculous. The remorse of
Philip after the murder of his wife and son is as grotesque
an instance of the forcible feeble as could easily be found,
and is a melancholy instance indeed of the declension of
the English drama, when contrasted with the demeanour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of Othello in similar circumstances. Otway, however, was
yet to show that his faults were rather his age&#8217;s than his
own. The fashion of rhyme must have had much to do
with the bombast of <i>Don Carlos</i>, for in <i>The Orphan</i>, his
next effort in serious tragedy, there is hardly any rant, even
when the situation might have seemed to have excused the
exaggerated expression of emotion. The central incident
of this admirable tragedy&mdash;the deception of a maiden beloved
by two brothers, through the personation of the
favoured one by his rival&mdash;seems now to be held to exclude
it from the stage. The objection would probably
prove to be imaginary, for the play was performed as late
as 1819, when no less an actress than Miss O&#8217;Neill represented
Monimia, and the diction is in general of quite
exemplary propriety for a play of the period. Its principal
defect as a work of art is that the pathos springs almost
solely from the situation, and that the personages have
hardly any hold upon our sympathies except as sufferers
from an unhappy fatality. So powerful is the situation,
nevertheless, that the sorrows of Castalio and Monimia can
never fail to move; the poet&#8217;s language, too, is at its best,
simpler and more remote from extravagance than even in
<i>Venice Preserved</i>. The description of the old hag is justly
celebrated:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;I spied a wrinkled hag, with age grown double,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Picking dry sticks, and mumbling to herself;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes with scalding rheum were galled and red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cold palsy shook her head, her hands seemed withered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her crooked shoulders had she wrapt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tattered remnant of an old striped hanging,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which served to keep her carcase from the cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So there was nothing of a piece about her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lower weeds were all o&#8217;er coarsely patched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With different coloured rags, black, red, white, yellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed to speak variety of wretchedness.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>There are also delightful touches of poetry:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&#8216;Oh, thou art tender all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gentle and kind as sympathizing nature!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a sad story has been told, I&#8217;ve seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy little breasts, with soft compassion swelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shove up and down and heave like dying birds.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The opening speech of act iv., sc. 2, also reveals a feeling
for nature unusual in Restoration poetry, and may be taken
to symbolize Otway&#8217;s regrets for the country. The items
of the description are in no way conventional, and would
not have occurred to one without experience of rural
life:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Wished morning&#8217;s come! And now upon the plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And distant mountains, where they feed their flocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy shepherds leave their homely huts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with their pipes proclaim the new-born day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lusty swain comes with his well-filled scrip<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of healthful viands, which, when hunger calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With much content and appetite he eats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To follow in the fields his daily toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dress the grateful glebe that yields him fruits.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beasts that under the warm hedges slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weathered out the cold bleak night, are up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looking towards the neighbouring pastures, raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their voice, and bid their fellow-brutes good-morrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cheerful birds, too, on the tops of trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assemble all in quires, and with their notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salute and welcome up the rising sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&#8217;s no condition here so cursed as mine.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>Venice Preserved</i>, Otway&#8217;s most memorable work, though
inferior in mere poetry and unstudied simplicity to <i>The
Orphan</i>, surpasses it in tragic grandeur, in variety of
action, and in intensity of interest. It has the further
great advantage that the interest does not entirely arise
from the situation, but that at least one of the characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
is a skilful piece of painting from the life, and very probably
from the author. In Jaffier we have a vivid portrait
of the man who is entirely governed by the affections, and
who sways from ardent resolution to a weakness hardly
distinguishable from treachery, as friendship and love
alternately incline him. The little we know of Otway
warrants the impression that he was such a man, and
assuredly he could not have excited such warm interest in
a character so feeble in his offence, so abject in his repentance,
and in general so perilously verging on the despicable,
without a keen sympathy with the subject of his
portrait. <i>Tout comprendre c&#8217;est tout pardonner.</i> Pierre,
though an imposing figure, is much less subtly painted
than his friend; and Belvidera, her husband&#8217;s evil genius,
interests only through her sorrows. The &#8216;despicable
scenes of low farce&#8217; which eke the drama out, are a
grievous blot upon it. M. Taine may be right in deeming
some comic relief allowable, but such trash is neither relief
nor comedy. The language of the serious portion of the
play, however, is in general dignified and tragic. Perhaps
the best conducted, as it is the best known, is that in which
Pierre spurns the remorseful Jaffier:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nathaniel Lee
(1653-1691).</div>

<p>The only tragic dramatist of the age,
after Dryden and Otway, who had any pretension
to rank as a poet, was Nathaniel
Lee, and his claims are not very high. Notwithstanding
his absurd rants, however, there are fire and passion in his
verse which lift him out of the class of mere playwrights.
After receiving a Cambridge education, Lee came up to
town to seek his fortune. Thrown on the world, it is said,
by the failure of the Duke of Ormond to redeem his
promises of patronage, Lee became an actor, but obtained
no success, although celebrated for the beauty of his
elocution as a dramatic reader. The transition from actor
to author was easy. Lee produced three bad rhyming
plays in the taste of the time, and in 1677 did himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
more justice in <i>The Rival Queens</i>, a tragedy on the history
of Alexander the Great, which kept the stage for nearly a
century and a half. <i>Mithridates</i> (1678) was also successful,
and Dryden thought sufficiently well of Lee to combine
with him in the production of an <i>&OElig;dipus</i>, which continued
to be acted until 1778, when the situation, rather than the
diction, was found unendurable. Kemble wished to revive
it so late as 1802, but was prevented by the reluctance of
Mrs. Siddons. It is true that on a modern stage the piece
must want the religious consecration which accompanied it
on the Greek. Lee wrote on, enjoying the notoriety of the
prohibition by authority of his <i>Lucius Junius Brutus</i>, in
which allusions, merely imaginary, to the vices of Charles
II., were discovered by the Court, and regaining his lost
favour by the tragedy of <i>The Duke of Guise</i> (1682), a play
full of political allusions, in which also Dryden had a
hand. In 1684 he was disabled by an attack of insanity,
brought on, it is alleged, by his intemperate habits; and
although he recovered sufficiently to be released from confinement,
he wrote no more, his last two published plays
being compositions of an earlier date. He died miserably
in returning from the tavern on a winter&#8217;s night, fallen
down and stifled in the snow.</p>

<p>That Lee was a poet, a passage quoted by Mr. Saintsbury
would prove, had he written nothing else:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&#8216;Thou coward! yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art living? canst not, wilt not, find the road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great palace of magnificent death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though thousand ways lead to his thousand doors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which day and night are still unbarred for all?&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A variation of this thought in Lee&#8217;s <i>Theodosius</i> might well
have inspired Beckford with the conception of his Hall of
Eblis, nor would it be difficult to find other impressive
passages. Lee&#8217;s rants of mere sound and fury are unfor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>tunately
much more frequent, and his pre-eminence above
all competitors in this line is so indisputable, that it is no
wonder if he is remembered by his gigantic faults rather
than by his comparatively tame and temperate merits.
The following speech of Roxana in <i>The Rival Queens</i>, for
instance, is quite an average specimen of her conversation:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;And shall the daughter of Darius hold him?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That puny girl? that ape of my ambition,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cried for milk when I was nursed in blood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall she, made up of watery element,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascend, shall she embrace my proper God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I am cast like lightning from his hand?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, I must scorn to prey on common things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though hurled to earth by this disdainful Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will rebound to my own orb of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the wrack of all the heavens expire.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Even when the thought is dignified and noble, it frequently
loses dramatic propriety from want of keeping
with the speaker or the situation:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&#8216;Therefore, my friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us despise the torrent of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune, I mean, and dam her up with fences,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banks, bulwarks, all the fortresses which virtue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved and manned like ours, can raise against her:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, if she does o&#8217;erflow, she may at least<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring but half ruin to our great designs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That being at last ashamed of her own weakness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a low-basd flood, she may retire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her own bounds, and we with pride o&#8217;erlook her.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Into what Cato&#8217;s mouth has Lee put this deliverance of
Stoic dignity? Truly, into Csar Borgia&#8217;s. Machiavelli
having been privy to all Borgia&#8217;s villainies, is selected to
pronounce the moral of the play:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;No power is safe, nor no religion good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose principles of growth are laid in blood.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A proposition supposed to have been irrefragably established
by five acts full of poniards and poisons. This
childish want of nature Lee shares with most of the tragic
dramatists of the Restoration period. He is mainly glare
and gewgaw, and seldom succeeds but in those scenes of passion
and frenzy where extravagant declamation seems a
natural language. There is little to remark on his dramatic
economy, which is that of the French classical drama. His
characters are boldly outlined and strongly coloured, but
transferred direct from history to the stage, or wholly
conventional. His merit is to have been really a poet.
&#8216;There is an infinite fire in his works,&#8217; says Addison, &#8216;but
so involved in smoke that it does not appear in half its
lustre.&#8217; The following scene from <i>Mithridates</i> is a fair
example of the mingled beauties and blemishes of his tragic
style:</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Crowne
(1640-1703?).</div>

<p>The remaining dramatists of the Restoration, with the
exception of the brilliant group of comic authors near the
end of the century, who demand a separate notice, un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>doubtedly
belong to the class of playwrights. The most
characteristic playwright of all, taking the term in the
sense of a steady competent workman destitute of originality,
was perhaps John Crowne. Crowne was the man to supply
the playhouses with a regular output of respectable
work, and, as he had no other object than
to suit his market, we perhaps learn better
from him and his like than from writers of genius what
the public of the day required. It seems rather extraordinary
that such heavy tragedies as Crowne&#8217;s should
have been marketable in any age; but it must be considered
that the tragic stage had to be kept going for
the sake of the actors, and that if people would not
have Shakespeare they must take what they could get.
Indifferent plays, moreover, may make fine spectacles; and
Crowne&#8217;s Julianas, Reguluses, and Caligulas served the
purpose of habitual playgoers, that is, of playgoers from
the force of habit, as well as better pieces.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The success
of Crowne&#8217;s comedies is less difficult to understand. Here
he really gave the public a fair reflection of itself, and
exhibited contemporary manners with truth, if with no
great brilliancy. On one occasion he soared higher, and
(1685) created a real type in the exquisite coxcomb, Sir
Courtly Nice. The rest of the play is partly imitated from
the Spanish, but the character of Nice is Crowne&#8217;s own.
The humour is considerably overdone, but is still a genuine
piece of comedy, which culminates at the end, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
infuriated fop rushes from the stage, vowing to be avenged,
&#8216;as far as my sword and my wit can go.&#8217; <i>The English
Friar</i> (1689), a satire on the Tartufes of the Roman
Catholic persuasion, is also a remarkable piece, the parent
of a long line of imitations. In <i>City Politics</i> (1673),
Crowne&#8217;s first comedy, the Whig party in the City is held
up to obloquy in the transparent disguise of a Neapolitan
rabble, and the satire is keen and vivid. <i>The Married
Beau</i> (1694) is remarkable as a reversion towards the style
of Fletcher and Shirley. <i>Calisto</i> is an interesting attempt
to revive the ancient masque. The only one of Crowne&#8217;s
serious dramas entitled to much attention is <i>Darius</i>, where
the poetry is frequently fine, but the characters are tame.
Not much is known of his life. He appears to have been
taken in youth to America, and to have returned by 1665,
when he published a romance entitled <i>Pandion and Amphigenia</i>.
His connection with the stage commenced in 1671
with <i>Juliana</i>, and terminated with <i>Caligula</i> in 1698. He
would seem to have been a precise and matter-of-fact man,
and is ridiculed by Rochester as &#8216;Little starch Johnny Crowne
with his ironed cravat.&#8217; He was fond of accompanying his
plays with long prefaces and dedications, which throw
some light on his opinions and private history, and, so far
as they go, exhibit his disposition in an advantageous
light. From one of them it appears that he suffered in
his latter days from &#8216;a distemper seated in my head.&#8217; His
tantalizing gleams of talent as a lyrist have been already
mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Southern
(1660-1746).</div>

<p>Thomas Southern undoubtedly belonged to the genus
playwright, and has none of the flashes
of poetry which occasionally seem to
exalt Crowne to a higher rank. His
distinction rather arises from the financial success of his
pieces, which was such that he died &#8216;the richest of all our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
poets, a very few excepted.&#8217; For this, however, he is said
to have been indebted not so much to the actual vogue of
his pieces as to his assiduity in soliciting tickets. It is to
be wished that he had been equally assiduous in collecting
facts about Shakespeare, if, as is somewhat doubtfully
asserted, his father came from Stratford-on-Avon. He
was born at Dublin in 1660, and is said to have been a
servitor at Oxford and a student at the Middle Temple.
This he forsook for the army, but his service cannot have
been of long duration. His first play, <i>The Loyal Brother</i>
(1682), was designed to compliment the Duke of York
upon the failure of the Exclusion Bill. He was not a very
industrious writer, producing only ten plays down to 1726,
and of these only two, <i>The Fatal Marriage</i> (1694) and
<i>Oroonoko</i> (1696), had any considerable reputation even in
his own day. Both, however, kept the stage until an
advanced period of the nineteenth century. The diction
of both pieces, though never rising into poetry, and interlarded
with dull scenes intended to be comic, is by no
means contemptible; the main strength, however, consists
in the situations, which are really powerful, and in the
writer&#8217;s art in arousing an interest both in his innocent
and his mixed characters. Respected as a relic of the
past, a decorous church-goer with silver hair, Southern
lived far into the eighteenth century, and came sufficiently
under its influence to repent of his mingling of tragic and
comic action in the same piece; which indeed he had reason
to regret, not because he had done it, but because he had
not done it better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Shadwell
(1640-1692).</div>

<p>Thomas Shadwell is remarkable as the leading Whig
votary of <i>belles lettres</i> after the death of
Marvell, a distinction which secured him
the laureateship upon the cashiering of
Dryden. To call him poet would be a gross misapplication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
of the term, and Dryden&#8217;s withering couplet might seem
justified if he had nothing but his serious verse to rely
upon:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;With all his bulk, there&#8217;s nothing lost in Og,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For every inch that is not fool is rogue.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>His title to recollection, however, rests upon things as
remote from poetry as possible&mdash;his coarsely indecent, but
humorous comedies, which are undoubtedly of value as
reflecting the manners of the time. Shadwell, in imitation
of Ben Jonson, laid himself out to study &#8216;humours,&#8217; so
well defined by Ben himself:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&#8216;When some peculiar quality<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth so possess a man that it doth draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All his affects, his spirits, and his powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their complexions all to run one way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This may be truly said to be a humour.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We have seen the like in Dickens, who, possessing little
delicacy of psychological observation, laid himself out to
study obvious eccentricities of character, the more grotesque
the better, and frequently made the entire man the
incarnation of an attribute. This is certainly not very
high art, but has recommendations for the stage which
it lacks in the novel; it is easy to write, easy to act, and
gives genuine entertainment to the crowd of spectators.
Shadwell valued himself so much upon his performances
in this way as to declare in his preface to <i>The Virtuoso</i>
that he trusted never to have less than four new humours
in any comedy. Shadwell&#8217;s plays, though poorly written,
might still be read for their humour, were it not for their
obscenity; his chief merit, however, is to bring the society
of his time nearer to us than any other writer. No other
records such minute points of manners, or enables us to
view the actual daily life of the age with so much clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>ness.
This is especially the case in his <i>Epsom Wells</i>
(1675), <i>Squire of Alsatia</i> (1688), and <i>Volunteers</i> (1692).
From Dryden&#8217;s satire, which must have had a basis of
truth, he would seem to have been just the boisterous
corpulent <i>bon vivant</i> we might expect. &#8216;If,&#8217; said Rochester,
&#8216;Shadwell would burn all he writes and print all he says,
he would have more wit and humour than anybody.&#8217; His
friend, Dr. Nicholas Brady, vouches for the openness and
friendliness of his temper; and further describes him as
&#8216;a complete gentleman.&#8217; But this was in a funeral sermon.
The regard for Otway, imputed to him by Rochester, is
creditable to him.</p>

<p>The violent death of Archbishop Abbot&#8217;s gamekeeper
would have passed unnoticed if the poor man had been
shot by anybody but the archbishop himself; and Elkanah
Settle (1648-1724) would have slipped away in the crowd
of poetasters if Rochester had not taken it into his head
to pit him against Dryden. In the sense in which the
mysterious W. H. was &#8216;the only begetter of Shakespeare&#8217;s
sonnets,&#8217; he may hence claim to be the parent of one of
the most scathing pieces of invective in the language.
Although, however, Doeg is undoubtedly Settle, Settle is
not wholly Doeg. Miserable as his lampoons are, a line
here and there is not destitute of piquancy; and if his
<i>Empress of Morocco</i> (1673) has no literary pretensions, it
is important in literary history for having so moved the
wrath of Dryden, and in the history of the drama for
having been issued with plates which contribute greatly
to our knowledge of the internal arrangements of the
Restoration Theatre. By a singular irony of fortune, his
fate bears some analogy to that of his mighty antagonist.
Settle lost caste by changing his politics at the wrong
time, as Dryden his religion; but while Dryden bore up
against the storm of adversity, Settle sunk into obscurity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and ultimately into the Charter House. Of his twenty
plays none but <i>The Empress of Morocco</i> is now ever mentioned,
unless an exception be made in favour of <i>Ibrahim,
the Illustrious Bassa</i> (1676), noticeable, as Professor Ward
remarks, for being founded upon one of the voluminous
French romances of the day.</p>

<p>Some other playwrights would deserve extended notice
in a history of the drama, but are only entitled to the barest
mention in a general literary survey. Among these are
Sir Robert Howard, Dryden&#8217;s brother-in-law, and joint-author
with him of <i>The Indian Queen</i>, the most important
of whose plays is <i>The Committee</i> (printed 1665), a satire on
the Commonwealth, described by Sir Roger de Coverley as
&#8216;a good old Church of England comedy:&#8217; John Wilson,
Recorder of Londonderry, author of three comedies and a
tragedy of more than average merit; Roger Boyle, Earl of
Orrery; Sir Charles Sedley, Major Thomas Porter, and John
Lacy, all very mediocre as dramatists; Thomas D&#8217;Urfey,
better known than any of the above, but not by his writings,
which are below mediocrity. The ten plays of Edward
Ravenscroft procured him no other reputation than that
of a plagiarist. Some female dramatists will be mentioned
in another place.</p>

<p>Before passing to the opulent comedy of the latter part
of the century, two writers remain to be mentioned, one of
whom stands alone in the drama of the period, while the
other forms the transition to the comedy of Wycherley and
Congreve. In describing George Villiers, second Duke of
Buckingham, as one standing apart, we refer to the
character of his solitary work, and not to his share in it;
for, though passing solely under his name, there can be
little doubt that it was the production of a junto of wits,
of whom he was not the wittiest. Butler, Sprat, and
Martin Clifford are named as his coadjutors. Bucking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>ham,
who must be credited with a keen sense of the ridiculous,
had already resolved to satirize rhyming heroic
plays in the person of Sir Robert Howard, when the latter&#8217;s
retirement diverted the blow to Dryden, whom Butler, as
we shall see, did not greatly relish, and against whose
device of rhyme, Sprat, as we have seen, had committed
himself by anticipation. The play chiefly selected for
parody is <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>, which certainly invited
it. Dryden appears as Bayes, in allusion to his laureateship;
and, although his perpetual use of &#8216;egad&#8217; seems
derived from the usage by one of his <i>dramatis personae</i>
rather than his own, we cannot doubt that his peculiarities
of speech and gesture were mostly copied to the life.
Within a week the town were unanimously laughing at what
they had been unanimously applauding; and, scurrilous
and ill-bred as the mockery of <i>The Rehearsal</i> was, it must
be allowed to have been neither uncalled for nor unuseful.
The machinery of the piece is sufficiently indicated by its
title. Bayes entertains the dissembling Johnson and the
unsympathetic Smith with a rehearsal of <i>The Two Kings of
Brentford</i>, commenting meanwhile and explaining, vaunting
beauties and extenuating miscarriages with a verve that
still amuses, notwithstanding the far superior treatment of
the same theme in Sheridan&#8217;s <i>Critic</i>. Some of the scenes
are highly farcical; and some of the passages are very
fair hits at the bombast and other extravagances of the
writers of heroic plays, for Dryden is by no means the sole
object of satire:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Yes, I think, for a dead person, it is a good way enough of
making love, for being divested of her terrestrial part, and all
that, she is only capable of these little, pretty, amorous designs
that are innocent, and yet passionate.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>One of Bayes&#8217;s precepts may be commended to the attention
of any who may think of reviving rhyming tragedy.
It also shows the cramped condition of the theatre in
Dryden&#8217;s day:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>&#8216;Bayes.</i> Gentlemen, I must desire you to remove a little, for
I must fill the stage.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Why fill the stage?</p>

<p><i>Bayes.</i> O sir, because your heroic verse never sounds well
but when the stage is full.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Sir George Etheredge
(1634-1691).</div>

<p>Sir George Etheredge is neither an edifying nor an attractive
writer of comedy, but his plays
are of considerable historical importance
as prototypes of the comedy of
manners afterwards so brilliantly developed by Congreve.
They are <i>Love in a Tub</i> (1664), <i>She Would if She Could</i>
(1668), and <i>The Man of Mode</i> (1676). The last is celebrated
for the character of Sir Fopling Flutter, who is said to
have been the image of the author, though it is added on
the same authority that his intention had been to depict
himself in the character of the heartless rake Dorimant,
whom others took for Rochester. All the plays suffer from
a deficiency of plot, a deficiency of wit, and a superfluity of
naughtiness, but cannot be denied to possess a light airy
grace, and to have imbibed something of the manner,
though little of the humour, of Molire. By his own
account the author was lazy, careless, and a gamester.
Little, except that &#8216;he was knighted for marrying a fortune,&#8217;
is known of his history until 1685, when, unexpectedly
to himself, he was appointed envoy to Ratisbon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
details become copious from the accidental preservation of
his letter-book, now in the British Museum. The general
tone of his correspondence is good-natured and easy; he
seems to have made just the kind of ambassador to be
expected from an idle man of fashion without diplomatic
experience; while he may well have merited his friends&#8217;
description of him as &#8216;gentle George,&#8217; and his repute as
easy and generous. The Revolution deprived him of his
post; he seems to have refused allegiance to William, and
to have died at Paris in 1691.</p>

<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LATER COMEDY OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</span></h2>

<p>Etheredge&#8217;s comedies serve to introduce one of the most
brilliant schools of English comic writing&mdash;faulty, in that
so far from correcting the manners of its age, it did not
even portray them, but eminent above the English
comedy of every other period for wit. So great is the
family likeness between its chief representatives, that it
will be advisable to consider their lives and their writings
together. The connecting link among them all is that
all were fine gentlemen whose code was the fashionable
morality of the day. Any conclusions as to the state of
contemporary manners which may be deduced from their
writings must be confined to this small, though conspicuous
section of English society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William Wycherley
(1640-1715).</div>

<p>William Wycherley was the son of a Shropshire gentleman
of good estate. His father, disliking
the management of public schools
under the Commonwealth, sent the
youth to France, where he became a Roman Catholic, but
recanted upon his return. He entered at the Temple, and
for some years led the life of a gay young man about
town. According to his own statement, all his four comedies
were written about this period, but Macaulay has
shown clearly that they must have, at all events, undergone
very considerable revision, and that it is not probable that
any but <i>Love in a Wood</i> were in existence when this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
acted in 1672. <i>The Gentleman Dancing Master</i>, <i>The Country
Wife</i>, and <i>The Plain Dealer</i>, appeared in 1673, 1675, and
1677 respectively; and the last of these was the termination
of the author&#8217;s brief and brilliant career as a dramatist.
It was also the term of his prosperity. A secret
marriage with a lady of rank offended the king, by whom
Wycherley had been entrusted with the tuition of one of
his natural children, and eventually involved him in debt.
He was thrown into the Fleet, where he remained several
years. At last James II., chancing to witness a representation
of <i>The Plain Dealer</i>, was led to inquire for the
author, and, a piece of munificence towards letters most
unusual with him, to pay his debts and grant him a pension
of two hundred a year, which, as Wycherley straightway
reverted to the Roman Catholic faith, was probably
withdrawn by William. He had, however, come into possession
of the family estate, and existed for the rest of his life
respectably as regarded his means of subsistence, though
much the reverse as regards the licentious verses which he
went on writing, and published at the age of sixty-four.
Macaulay and Mr. Gosse, however, attribute to him a tract in
defence of the stage against Jeremy Collier, not devoid of
merit; and his later poems enjoyed the advantage of
revision by Pope, whose hand, Macaulay thinks, is everywhere
discernible. Comedy he never essayed again. He
died in 1715, having ten days before his death married a
young girl to injure his nephew. This Macaulay considers
the worst of his actions; but we do not know that
the nephew did not deserve to be injured. A contemporary
poet dubs the uncle, &#8220;generous Wycherley.&#8221;</p>

<div class="sidenote">William Congreve
(1670-1729).</div>

<p>William Congreve, a scion of a good
Staffordshire family, was born at Bardsey,
near Leeds, in 1670. His father,
an officer in the army, obtained a command in Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
where a branch of the family is still settled, and Congreve
received his education at Kilkenny and at Trinity College,
Dublin. In 1691 he came to London, and at once found
admission to the best literary circles. A novel by him,
<i>Incognita</i>, was published anonymously at the beginning of
1692. Later in the year he co-operated in a translation of
Juvenal by various hands, and submitted his <i>Old Bachelor</i>
to Dryden, who declared that he had never seen such a
first play, and lent his aid in adapting it for the stage. It
was produced with great success in January, 1693. In
November of the same year <i>The Double-Dealer</i> appeared,
but, though preferred by the judicious, was less popular
with the town. It was published with an elegant preface
by the author, and a noble panegyric from Dryden.
&#8216;Perhaps,&#8217; says Mr. Gosse, &#8216;there is no other example of
such full and generous praise of a young colleague by a
great old poet.&#8217; Dryden&#8217;s notions of architecture, indeed,
seem borrowed from the churches of his time, where we
not uncommonly see a spire in one style clapped upon a
body in another:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Fine Doric pillars found your solid base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair Corinthian crowns the higher space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus all below is strength and all above is grace.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the lines in which he adjures Congreve to protect
his own memory are an unparalleled blending of pathos
and compliment:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Be kind to my remains, and O, defend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against your judgment, your departed friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let not the insulting foe my fame pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shade those laurels which descend to you.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Shortly after the performance of <i>The Double Dealer</i>,
dissensions broke out between the patentees of the Theatre
Royal and their <i>corps dramatique</i>, and the majority of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
latter seceded to Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields. Congreve followed
them, and, in consideration of receiving a stipulated share
of the profits, agreed to write for them a play annually,
should his health permit. In pursuance of this agreement,
<i>Love for Love</i>, generally considered the best of his comedies,
was brought out in April, 1695. It was a signal
success; as was Congreve&#8217;s solitary tragedy, <i>The Mourning
Bride</i>, produced in 1697, which, indeed, is believed to have
produced him more than any of his comedies. The last,
and, in the opinion of some, the best of these, <i>The Way of
the World</i>, appeared in 1700, and its failure disgusted
Congreve with the stage. He had always rather affected
to condescend to be a dramatist, as Monsieur Jourdain
condescended to be a haberdasher; and he was probably
hurt at the rough handling he had received from Jeremy
Collier, to whose <i>Short View of the Immorality and
Profaneness of the Stage</i> he had unsuccessfully endeavoured
to reply. Collier&#8217;s victory, indeed, proved that the
licentiousness of the stage was a mere fashion, rather tolerated
than approved by the majority of the playgoing
public, and Congreve may have felt that his wings would
be clipped by the reformation which public opinion was
evidently about to demand. Whatever the cause, he was
lost to the stage at thirty, and his occasional poetical productions,
the most important of which have been already
noticed, were far from qualifying him to sit in the seat of
Dryden. He enjoyed, nevertheless, supremacy of another
kind. Regarded as an extinct volcano, he gave umbrage
to no rivals; his urbane and undemonstrative temper kept
him out of literary feuds; all agreed to adore so benign
and inoffensive a deity, and the general respect of the
lettered world fitly culminated in Pope&#8217;s dedication of his
<i>Homer</i> to him, the most splendid literary tribute the age
could bestow. Sinecure Government places made his cir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>cumstances
more than easy, but he suffered continually
from gout, the effect of free living, and he became blind,
or nearly so, in his latter years. His death (1729) was
hastened by a carriage accident. He had a splendid
funeral in Westminster Abbey, and a monument erected
by the Duchess of Marlborough (Marlborough&#8217;s daughter,
not his widow), whom he had capriciously made his principal
legatee.</p>

<p>It is, as Mr. Gosse remarks, difficult to form any very
distinct notion of Congreve as a man. We must be content
with knowing that he was a fine gentleman before all
things, convivial in his habits, witty in conversation, extremely
sensitive to criticism, otherwise placid; able to
keep on good terms with both Pope and Dennis throughout
his life; and that Pope thought him, Garth, and Vanbrugh,
&#8216;the three most honest-hearted real good men of the
poetical members of the Kit-cat Club.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir John Vanbrugh
(1664-1726).</div>

<p>Sir John Vanbrugh, the next of the quartette of illustrious
comic writers, occupies a remarkable
position in literature. Few other
distinguished architects have gained
renown in elegant letters, and these have not attempted
the drama. As, however, Angelo is more celebrated for
St. Peter&#8217;s than for his sonnets, so Vanbrugh is better
remembered by Blenheim, which most have beheld, than
by his plays, which are never seen on the stage, and yet
connoisseurs have found infinitely more to censure in the
former. The faults of the plays are those of the author&#8217;s
age and his school; the faults imputed to his buildings, if
they exist, which is a question for architects, are personal
to the Fleming, who shared his countryman Rubens&#8217;s
taste for the massive and substantial, and whose epitaph
was couched in the adjuration:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Lie heavy on him, earth, for he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid many a heavy load on thee.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Though born an English subject, Vanbrugh was of Flemish
descent. His first profession was the army. His <i>dbut</i>
as a dramatist was made in 1697 by two sparkling comedies,
<i>The Relapse</i> and <i>The Provoked Wife</i>, followed by <i>The
False Friend</i> (1702), <i>The Confederacy</i>, and <i>The Mistake</i>
(1705), some imitations of the French, and an unfinished
play, <i>A Journey to London</i>, completed by Cibber, and produced
in 1728 as <i>The Provoked Husband</i>. All these plays
seem to have been successful; certainly none were in
any peril of damnation on the ground apprehended by
Orrery:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;This play, I&#8217;m horribly afraid, can&#8217;t last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allow it pretty, &#8217;tis confounded chaste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And contradicts too much the present taste.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Latterly he became somewhat careless in the composition
of his plays, which may be reasonably attributed to the
demands made upon him by the laborious profession of
architecture, which he took up, apparently without a regular
education, about the end of the seventeenth century, and
which he may have been the more inclined to pursue on
account of the serious loss entailed upon him by his
dramatic speculations. Interest or ability made him successful;
he was entrusted with no less a task than the
erection of Blenheim; and Castle Howard and other celebrated
country mansions were built after his designs. He
died in 1726. The little known of his personal character
is to his credit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">George Farquhar
(1678-1707).</div>

<p>George Farquhar was born at Londonderry in 1678, and
is believed to have been the son of an
Irish clergyman. He forsook Trinity
College for the stage, where he made
some figure, but renounced his calling out of compunction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
for having accidentally wounded a fellow-actor. Coming to
London with ten guineas lent to him by the manager, he
achieved renown by his comedy of <i>Love and a Bottle</i> (1699).
<i>The Constant Couple</i> (1701) was even more successful.
Other plays followed, and from allusions in one of the
principal, <i>The Recruiting Officer</i> (1706), as well as reminiscences
and traditions, he is believed to have held a commission
in the army. According to tradition, he was induced
to sell his commission to pay his debts by the Duke
of Ormond&#8217;s promise to procure him another, and the disappointment
of this expectation so deeply mortified him as
to occasion his death. His last and best comedy, <i>The
Beaux&#8217; Stratagem</i>, was written on his deathbed. He is a
sympathetic figure among the literary men of the day,
gallant and witty, nor incapable of serious feeling. According
to his own account he was, like Liston and others who
have contributed to the mirth of mankind, by nature a
melancholy man. &#8216;As to the mind, which in most men
wears as many changes as their body, so in me &#8217;tis generally
drest like my person, in black. Melancholy is its
everyday apparel, and it has hitherto found few holidays
to make it change its clothes.&#8217; He adds: &#8216;I am seldom
troubled by what the world calls airs and caprices; and I
think &#8217;tis an idiot&#8217;s excuse for a foolish action to say,
&#8217;twas my humour. I hate all little malicious tricks of
vexing people; and I can&#8217;t relish the jest that vexes
another in earnest. If ever I do a wilful injury, it must
be a very great one. I have so natural a propensity to
ease, that I cannot cheerfully fix to any study which bears
not a pleasure in the application; which makes me inclinable
to poetry above anything else. I have very little
estate but what lies under the circumference of my hat;
and should I by mischance come to lose my head, I should
not be worth a groat; but I ought to thank Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
that I can by three hours&#8217; study live one-and-twenty with
satisfaction to myself, and contribute to the maintenance
of more families than some who have thousands a year. I
have something in my outward behaviour which gives
strangers a worse opinion of me than I deserve; but I am
more than recompensed by the opinion of my acquaintance,
which is as much above my desert.&#8217;</p>

<p>This, which is only part of a much longer character,
addressed to a lady, is remarkable as the most detailed
self-estimate of any man of letters of the period we possess,
until we come to Steele.</p>

<p>Although there are undoubtedly considerable distinctions
between the works of these four dramatists, such a fundamental
unity nevertheless prevails among them that they
may be advantageously considered together. They may be
compared to a jewel with four facets, each casting a separate
ray, but with little diversity in their cold brilliant
glitter. Wit, gaiety, heartlessness, and profligacy are the
common notes of them all, save that Congreve has tragic
power, and, as well as Farquhar, real feeling. How
far they painted, or intended to paint, the manners of
their age, is a difficult question. Lamb thought that the
world they depict was merely conventional, a Lampsacene
Arcadia. Not even the indulgent Leigh Hunt, much less
the austere Macaulay, can concur in this judgment, which
is assuredly much too absolute. Yet it is indisputable that
the manners they portray were not those of a nation that
devoured <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>, brought up children and
domestics by the <i>Whole Duty of Man</i>, and deposed a king
who meddled with the Church. Were they even the
manners of the gay world? To some extent this is true;
but there is evidence enough that even fashionable men
thought of something else than seducing their neighbours&#8217;
wives and daughters; that the slips even of fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
women were by no means inordinately frequent or mere
matters of course; and that the standard of personal
honour was much higher than would appear from the
comedies. We may be assisted to comprehend the real
state of the matter by observing the condition of the
French literature of fiction at this very moment. Anyone
who should form his opinion of French people
entirely from their novels could come to no other conclusion
than that they were entirely given up to the pursuit of
illicit love, and deemed nothing else worthy of the attention
of a rational creature. Yet we know that as a matter of
fact the French nation does think of very different things;
that a ridiculously small corner of actual life is conventionally
made to stand for the whole of it; that the novels
which profess to depict manners, while accurate in their
delineation of certain characters and certain phases, would
entirely mislead those whose notions should be solely
derived from them. It would be nearer the truth, though
still erroneous, to take the reverse view, and maintain that
works composed for the sake of amusement are more likely
to usher the reader into an ideal world than to weary him
with familiar scenes and incidents. So far as this is the
case, the English society of the seventeenth century must
be acquitted at the expense of the dramatists, who incur
the obloquy of missing both the two great ends of comedy,
for they neither delineate nor correct it. Possibly the
unsatisfactory position which writers of so much wit and
sense thus came to occupy may be partly accounted for
by the influence of Ben Jonson. We have seen Dryden
almost hesitating to avow his preference for Shakespeare
to Jonson, we shall see that Butler has no hesitation in
asserting the superiority of Jonson to Shakespeare as an
obvious thing; nor could it well be otherwise in so essentially
prosaic an age. This implies the triumph of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
comedy of types over the comedy of nature. Jonson, like
Menander, impersonates particular characteristics, or situations
in life; Shakespeare paints human nature as large
as it really is. We have seen how the exhibition of these
so-called &#8216;humours&#8217; forms the staple of the comedy of
Shadwell. The handling of Congreve and his associates,
who had the example of Molire before them, is far
superior, but the principle is at bottom the same. A
characteristic is incarnated in a personage, and often indicated
by his very name. Instead of the names bestowed
by fancy, or borrowed from romance, the Benedicts, Rosalinds,
Imogens, Mirandas, we have Witwoulds, Maskwells,
Millamants, and Gibbets. Each character being thus more
or less conventional, the <i>tout ensemble</i> is necessarily conventional
too; and to this extent the world of these dramatists
may be fairly regarded as ideal; while it is not true that
they had any definite purpose of creating such a world, or
that it was so dissimilar to actual society as to interfere
with the appreciation of the audience. Their works may be
compared to the novels of Mr. George Meredith, who would
have been a great comic writer if he had lived in the days
of Congreve. No one would call Mr. Meredith&#8217;s novels
unnatural; yet his works will convey but little notion of
the English society of the nineteenth century to posterity,
who will only need to turn to George Eliot and Anthony
Trollope to realize it as no bygone age was ever realized
before.</p>

<p>Wycherley has been characterized by Professor Ward as
the Timon of his stage, and the description is excellent, if
not understood of one animated by moral indignation at
its immorality, but of one impelled by temperament to
insist upon and exaggerate its most disagreeable features.
The two most important of his plays, <i>The Country Wife</i>
and <i>The Plain Dealer</i>, are rather tragi-comedies than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
comedies, especially the latter, of which Professor Ward
justly observes, &#8216;Working within the limits of his own
horizon, with nothing perceptible to him but a vicious
world hateful on account of the palpable grossness of its
outward pretences, Wycherley must be allowed to have worked
with vigour and effect, and to have produced what is indisputably
one of the most powerful dramas of its age.&#8217; Its
unpardonable sin is to be to a great extent an adaptation
of Molire&#8217;s <i>Misanthrope</i>, and to pervert and brutalize whatever
is most admirable in that masterpiece. <i>Love in a Wood</i>
and <i>The Gentleman Dancing Master</i> are comparatively
slight performances, but there is great humour in the
representation in the latter of the disguised lover helped
out of all his scrapes by the self-complacent credulity of
the young lady&#8217;s father and his own rival, whose business
it is to detect him. The delineation of the father as a
merchant returned from long residence in Spain, enamoured
of Spanish manners, and quoting the language at every
second sentence, is one of those which justify Aubrey&#8217;s
remark that the dramatists of his age would be soon forgotten,
because their ephemeral &#8216;humours&#8217; would have
ceased to be intelligible. The character, if still possible in
Wycherley&#8217;s time, ceased to be so very soon afterwards.
It must, however, have been popular if it gave or helped
to give the nickname of Don Diego to the Spaniards, which
survives to this day in &#8216;dago,&#8217; the familiar appellation of
South Americans in the United States. One characteristic
of all Wycherley&#8217;s comedies should be mentioned, their
length, which confirms the impression that he composed
with slowness. &#8216;When,&#8217; says Hazlitt, &#8216;he got hold of a good
thing, or sometimes even of a bad one, he was determined
to make the most of it, and might have said with Dogberry,
&#8220;Had I the tediousness of a king, I could find it in my
heart to bestow it all upon your worships.&#8221;&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>If Wycherley is the satirist of Restoration comedy, Congreve
is its wit; but at the same time he betrays a vein of
much deeper feeling than Wycherley, and, notwithstanding
the contrary opinion of Hazlitt, his characters appear to us
more easily appreciated and more readily remembered.
His insight into women in particular is so considerable that
it is a real loss that he never attempted to paint a noble
one, who would indeed have looked strangely amid the
crowd of his heartless, or frivolous, or absurd people, but
whom he might have rendered a true dramatic success.
Both <i>The Double Dealer</i> and <i>The Way of the World</i> border
upon tragedy, and suggest how much finer things Congreve
might have written had the taste of his time allowed
of tragedy in prose; or if, by treating ordinary domestic
life in a serious spirit, even though in verse, he could
have taken the step that was afterwards taken by Lillo.
He evidently felt conscious of innate tragic power, and
essayed heroic tragedy in <i>The Mourning Bride</i>, where,
hampered by the conventionalities he dared not transgress,
he broke down with a romantic plot, romantic characters,
and stilted blank verse, all things most repugnant to his
genius. Johnson&#8217;s praise of a passage in this play as &#8216;the
most poetical paragraph in the whole mass of English
poetry,&#8217; and which is actually fine enough to survive such
extravagant laudation, is well known. It will be instructive
to set it side by side with a still finer passage in
a modern tragedy, as examples of the classic and romantic
schools of composition. It is the strength and weakness of
Congreve that his thoughts are such as would naturally
have occurred to any one in the situation of his personages,
and that his sole part is to afford them dignified expression;
while Beddoes&#8217; thoughts are the thoughts of a poet,
and as such might well appear fantastic and overstrained to
an average audience:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer of these lines might have been a great tragic
poet, if he could have achieved the construction of a coherent
plot. Congreve might have been a greater, but for the
conventions of an age that required his <i>dramatis personae</i>
to be remote by a thousand years or a thousand miles.</p>

<p>The dazzle of Congreve&#8217;s wit has perhaps blinded critics
to his more serious powers, and it may be that its brilliancy
has been even exaggerated. What is chiefly admirable is
perhaps not so much the occasional flashes and strokes,
felicitous as they are, as the unflagging verve, energy, and
gaiety. His plays are not of the kind that keep the
audience in a roar from first to last, but they never cease
to stimulate the spirits; the fire does not always blaze, but
it never burns low: there is not a dull scene, or a tiresome
or useless character. The general tone of good breeding, if
it does not purify the pervading atmosphere of profligacy,
at any rate prevents it from becoming offensive. In verbal
impropriety and <i>double entendre</i> Congreve is even worse
than Wycherley, but his plays are far from giving the same
impression of a thoroughly obnoxious state of society. It
is true that the pursuit of women seems the sole business
of the men, and the pursuit of men the business of half the
women; but the universal passion is so pleasantly variegated
with extraneous humours and oddities that it is far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
from producing the monotony of a modern French novel.
Thus, there is an amourette between Brisk and Lady
Froth in <i>The Double Dealer</i>, but the pair are sthetic
as well as amorous, and the blue-stocking is more conspicuous
than the unfaithful wife. The scene where
Brisk corrects Lady Froth&#8217;s poetry, imitated but not servilely
copied from one in <i>Les Femmes Savantes</i>, is a good
specimen of the humour and sparkle of Congreve&#8217;s
dialogue:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;<i>Lady Froth.</i> Then you think that episode between Susan,
the dairy-maid, and our coachman, is not amiss; you know I
may suppose the dairy in town as well as in the country.</p>

<p><i>Brisk.</i> Incomparable, let me perish!&mdash;But then being an
heroic poem, had not you better call him a charioteer? charioteer
sounds great; besides, your ladyship&#8217;s coachman having a red
face, and you comparing him to the sun; and you know the sun
is called heaven&#8217;s charioteer.</p>

<p>Congreve excels not only in dialogue, but in painting
a character by a single speech. How thoroughly we realize
the inward and outward man of old Foresight the omen-monger,
from a single passage in <i>Love for Love</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;<i>Nurse.</i> Pray heaven send your worship good luck! marry and
amen with all my heart; for you have put on one stocking with
the wrong side outward.</p>

<p><i>Fore.</i> Ha! hm? faith and troth I&#8217;m glad of it. And so I have;
that may be good luck in troth, in troth it may, very good luck:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
nay I have had some omens: I got out of bed backwards too this
morning, without premeditation; pretty good that too; but then
I stumbled coming down stairs, and met a weasel; bad omens
these, some bad, some good, our lives are chequered; mirth and
sorrow, want and plenty, night and day, make up our time. But
in troth I am pleased at my stocking; very well pleased at my
stocking.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Or Mr. Bluffe, the <i>miles gloriosus</i> of <i>The Old Bachelor</i>:</p>

<p>Vanbrugh has less individuality than his eminent contemporaries,
and has consequently produced less impression
than they upon the public mind, has added fewer typical
characters to comedy, and stands some steps nigher to
oblivion. Yet he is their equal in <i>vis comica</i>, and their
superior in stage workmanship. &#8216;He is no writer at all,&#8217;
says Hazlitt, &#8216;as to mere authorship; but he makes up for
it by a prodigious fund of comic invention and ludicrous
description, bordering upon caricature. He has none of
Congreve&#8217;s graceful refinement, and as little of Wycherley&#8217;s
serious manner and studious insight into the springs of
character; but his exhibition of it in dramatic contrast and
unlooked-for situations, where the different parties play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
upon one another&#8217;s failings, and into one another&#8217;s hands,
keeping up the jest like a game of battledore and shuttlecock,
and urging it to the utmost verge of breathless extravagance,
in the mere eagerness of the fray, is beyond that
of any other of our writers.&#8217; In Hazlitt&#8217;s opinion, Vanbrugh
did not bestow much pains upon the construction of
his pieces, and their excellent dramatic effect is mainly to
be attributed to his promptness in seizing upon the hints
for powerful situations which continually arose as he
went along. He has nothing of the passion which sometimes
raises Congreve so near to the confines of tragedy,
nor has he the airy gaiety of Farquhar; but his animal
spirits are abundant and unforced, and his humour has
a true Flemish exuberance. His characters are always
lively and well discriminated, but the only type he can be
said to have created is the model fop, Lord Foppington
in <i>The Relapse</i>, and even he is partly borrowed from
Etheredge&#8217;s Sir Fopling Flutter. He is nevertheless a most
perfect portrait, and gives real literary distinction to what
would otherwise have been a mere comedy of intrigue.
The powerful though disagreeable character of Sir John
Brute lends force to <i>The Provoked Wife</i>; and the unfinished
<i>Journey to London</i> is grounded on an idea which
might have been very fruitful, the country senator who has
gone into Parliament as a speculation, but who, upon
taking up his residence in London, finds that he loses more
by the extravagance of his wife than he can gain by the
prostitution of his vote. Vanbrugh&#8217;s other plays are mere
comedies of intrigue, written without moral or immoral
purpose for the sake of amusement, of which they are
abundantly prolific for readers not repelled by a disregard
of virtue so open and unblushing that, being too gay
for cynicism, it almost seems innocence. The scene between
Flippanta and her pupil in <i>The Confederacy</i> is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
excellent specimen of Vanbrugh&#8217;s spirited comedy. It
might be headed, <i>Malitia supplet aetatem</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;<i>Flip.</i> Nay, if you can bear it so, you are not to be pitied so
much as I thought.</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> Not pitied! Why, is it not a miserable thing for such a
young creature as I am should be kept in perpetual solitude,
with no other company but a parcel of old fumbling masters, to
teach me geography, arithmetic, philosophy, and a thousand useless
things? Fine entertainment, indeed, for a young maid at sixteen!
Methinks one&#8217;s time might be better employed.</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> Those things will improve your wit.</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> Fiddle, faddle! han&#8217;t I wit enough already? My
mother-in-law has learned none of this trumpery, and is not she
as happy as the day is long?</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> Then you envy her I find?</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> And well I may. Does she not do what she has a mind
to, in spite of her husband&#8217;s teeth?</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Look you there now! If she has not already
conceived that as the supreme blessing of life!</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> I&#8217;ll tell you what, Flippanta; if my mother-in-law would
but stand by me a little, and encourage me, and let me keep her
company, I&#8217;d rebel against my father to-morrow, and throw all
my books in the fire. Why, he can&#8217;t touch a groat of my portion;
do you know that, Flippanta!</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] So&mdash;I shall spoil her! Pray Heaven the girl
don&#8217;t debauch me!</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> Look you: in short, he may think what he pleases, he
may think himself wise; but thoughts are free, and I may think
in my turn. I&#8217;m but a girl, &#8217;tis true, and a fool too, if you&#8217;ll believe
him; but let him know, a foolish girl may make a wise
man&#8217;s heart ache; so he had as good be quiet.&mdash;Now it&#8217;s
out.</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> Very well, I love to see a young woman have spirit, it&#8217;s
a sign she&#8217;ll come to something.</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> Ah, Flippanta! if you would but encourage me, you&#8217;d
find me quite another thing. I&#8217;m a devilish girl in the bottom;
I wish you&#8217;d but let me make one amongst you.</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> That never can be till you are married. Come, examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
your strength a little. Do you think you durst venture upon a
husband?</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> A husband! Why, a&mdash;if you would but encourage me.
Come, Flippanta, be a true friend now. I&#8217;ll give you advice when
I have got a little more experience. Do you in your conscience
and soul think I am old enough to be married?</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> Old enough! why, you are sixteen, are you not?</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> Sixteen! I am sixteen, two months, and odd days,
woman. I keep an exact account.</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> The deuce you are!</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> Why, do you then truly and sincerely think I am old
enough?</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> I do, upon my faith, child.</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> Why, then, to deal as fairly with you, Flippanta, as you
do with me, I have thought so any time these three years.</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> Now I find you have more wit than ever I thought you
had; and to show you what an opinion I have of your discretion,
I&#8217;ll show you a thing I thought to have thrown in
the fire.</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> What is it, for Jupiter&#8217;s sake?</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> Something will make your heart chuck within you.</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> My dear Flippanta!</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> What do you think it is?</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> I don&#8217;t know, nor I don&#8217;t care, but I&#8217;m mad to
have it.</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> It&#8217;s a four-cornered thing.</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> What, like a cardinal&#8217;s cap?</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> No, &#8217;tis worth a whole conclave of &#8217;em. How do you
like it?</p>

<p class="ralign">[<i>Showing the letter.</i></p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> O Lard, a letter! Is there ever a token in it?</p>

<p><i>Flip.</i> Yes, and a precious one too. There&#8217;s a handsome young

take letters when I don&#8217;t know who they are from.</p>

<p>Farquhar has what Vanbrugh wants&mdash;individuality. He
seems to identify himself with his favourite characters, the
heedless, dissolute, but gentlemanly and good-hearted
sparks about town whom he so delights to portray, and
hence wins a firmer place in our affections than his wittier
and in every way stronger rival, who might have been a
comic automaton for any idea of his personality that we
are able to form. Whether the inevitable conception of
Farquhar is really correct may be doubted; it is not in
harmony with the few particulars which we possess of his
manners and personal appearance. While reading him,
nevertheless, one feels no doubt of the applicability to the
author of the character of his Sir Harry Wildair, &#8216;entertaining
to others, and easy to himself, turning all passion
into gaiety of humour.&#8217; The plays answer the description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of the personage; they are lively, rattling, entertaining,
and the humour is certainly much in excess of the passion.
Serjeant Kite, in <i>The Recruiting Officer</i>, has become proverbial,
otherwise no character has been recognized as an
absolute creation, though almost all are natural and unaffected.
<i>The Beaux&#8217; Stratagem</i>, his last play, is by common
consent his best; it is assuredly admirable, from the truth
and variety of the characters, and the pervading atmosphere
of adventurous gaiety. The separation between
Mr. and Mrs. Sullen is a good specimen of Farquhar&#8217;s <i>vis
comica</i>:</p>

<p>Farquhar is fuller of allusions to contemporary events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and humours than any of the other dramatists, and these
are sometimes very happy; as when a promising scheme
is said to be in danger of &#8216;going souse into the water, like
the Eddystone lighthouse,&#8217; or when an alarm is given by
shouting, &#8216;Thieves! thieves! murder! <i>popery!</i>&#8217; Another
peculiarity of all these dramatists, but especially Farquhar,
is the constant use in serious passages of a broken blank
verse, which continually seems upon the point of becoming
regular ten-syllabled iambic, but never maintains this
elevation for any considerable space. The extremely
powerful scene between the two Fainalls, in Congreve&#8217;s
<i>Love for Love</i>, for example, which borders closely upon
tragedy, is all but regular blank verse, which, if perfectly
finished, would be much better than the verse of <i>The
Mourning Bride</i>. It is difficult to determine whether this
was intentional or accidental. Possibly the exigencies of
the performers had something to do with it. It is by no
means unlikely that prose, as well as verse, was then
declaimed with more attention to rhythm than is now the
custom. In estimating the merits of these dramas it must
never be forgotten, as a point in their favour, that they
were written for the stage, and that success in the closet
was quite a secondary consideration with the authors; on
the other hand, that they had the advantage of being
produced when the histrionic art of England was probably
at its zenith.</p>

<p>This notice of the later Restoration comedy may be completed
by the mention of three ladies who cultivated it with
success during the latter part of the seventeenth century.
How much of this success, in the case of one of them, was
due to merit, and how much to indecency, is a difficult,
though not in every sense of the term a nice or delicate
question. Despite the offensiveness of her writings,
Aphra Behn (1640-1689), whose maiden name was John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>son,
is personally a sympathetic figure. She was born in
1640, and as a girl went out with her family to Surinam,
then an English possession. She there made the acquaintance
of the Indian chief Oroonoko and his bride Imoinda,
afterwards celebrated in the novel by her upon which
Southern founded his popular play. Returning to England,
she married a Dutch merchant of the name of Behn,
and after his death was sent as a spy to Antwerp. A
young Dutchman to whom she was engaged died; she was
wrecked and nearly drowned upon her return to England;
and, probably from necessity, as the English government
appears to have refused to recompense or even to reimburse
her, turned novelist and playwright. Her novels will be
noticed in another place; her eighteen plays have, with
few exceptions, sufficient merit to entitle her to a respectable
place among the dramatists of her age, and sufficient
indelicacy to be unreadable in this. It may well be
believed, on the authority of a female friend, that the
authoress &#8216;had wit, humour, good-nature, and judgment;
was mistress of all the pleasing arts of conversation; was
a woman of sense, and <i>consequently</i> a woman of pleasure.&#8217;
She was buried in Westminster Abbey, but not in Poets&#8217;
Corner. The plays of Mrs. Manley (1672-1724), though
moderately successful, need not detain us here, but we
shall have to speak of her as a writer of fiction. She was
the daughter of a Cavalier knight, but became the mistress
of Alderman Barber, and was concerned in several
doubtful transactions. Swift, nevertheless, speaks of her
as a good person &#8216;for one of her sort&#8217;&mdash;fat and forty, it
seems, but <i>not</i> fair. Mrs. Susannah Centlivre (1667-1723)
appears to have had her share of adventures in her youth,
but survived to contract one of the most respectable unions
imaginable, namely, with the queen&#8217;s cook. She was a
wholesale adapter from the French, and her lively comedies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
possess little literary merit, but so much dramatic instinct
that three of them, <i>The Busy Body</i>, <i>The Wonder</i>, and <i>A
Bold Stroke for a Wife</i>, remained long upon the list of
acting plays, and might be represented even now.</p>

<br />
<span class="smaller">CRITICISM.</span></h2>

<p>The age of the Restoration possessed many men qualified
to shine in criticism, but their acumen is in general only
indicated by casual remarks, and, setting aside the metrical
prolusions of Roscommon and Sheffield, nearly all the
serious criticism it has bequeathed to us proceeds from
the pen of Dryden. No other of our poets except Coleridge
and Wordsworth has given us anything so critically
valuable, but Dryden&#8217;s principal service is one which they
could not render; for, even if their style had equalled
his&mdash;and this would be too much to say even of Wordsworth&#8217;s&mdash;it
could not have exerted the same wide and
salutary influence. Dryden is entitled to be considered
as the great reformer of English prose, the writer in whom
the sound principles of the Restoration were above all
others impersonated, and who above all others led the
way to that clear, sane, and balanced method of writing
which it was the especial mission of Restoration literature
to introduce. We need only compare his style with
Milton&#8217;s to be sensible of the enormous progress in the
direction of perspicuity and general utility. Milton is a
far more eloquent writer, but his style is totally unfit
for the close reasoning and accurate investigation which
the pressure of politics and the development of science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and philosophy were soon to require, and the rest of the
prosaists of the time are, with few exceptions, either too
pedantic or too commonplace. Dryden is lucid, easy,
familiar, yet he can be august and splendid on occasion,
and if he does not emulate Milton&#8217;s dithyrambic, the
dignity of English prose loses nothing in his hands. Take
the opening of his <i>Dialogue on Dramatic Poesy</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;It was that memorable day, in the first summer of the late
war, when our navy engaged the Dutch; a day wherein the two
most mighty and best appointed fleets which any age had ever
seen, disputed the command of the greater half of the globe, the
commerce of nations, and the riches of the universe: while these
vast floating bodies, on either side, moved against each other in
parallel lines, and our countrymen, under the happy conduct of
his royal highness, went breaking, by little and little, into the
line of the enemies; the noise of the cannon from both navies
reached our ears about the city, so that all men being alarmed
with it, and in a dreadful suspense of the event, which they
knew was then deciding, every one went following the sound as
his fancy led him; and leaving the town almost empty, some
took towards the park, some across the river, others down it; all
seeking the noise in the depth of silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;Amongst the rest, it was the fortune of Eugenius, Crites,
Lisideius, and Neander, to be in company together; three of them
persons whom their wit and quality have made known to all the
town; and whom I have chose to hide under these borrowed names,
that they may not suffer by so ill a relation as I am going to
make of their discourse.</p>

<p>&#8216;Taking then a barge, which a servant of Lisideius had provided
for them, they made haste to shoot the bridge, and left
behind them that great fall of waters which hindered them from
hearing what they desired: after which, having disengaged themselves
from many vessels which rode at anchor in the Thames,
and almost blocked up the passage towards Greenwich, they
ordered the watermen to let fall their oars more gently, and then,
every one favouring his own curiosity with a strict silence, it was
not long ere they perceived the air to break about them like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
noise of distant thunder, or of swallows in a chimney:<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> those
little undulations of sound, though almost vanishing before they
reached them, yet still seeming to retain somewhat of their first
horror, which they had betwixt the fleets. After they had attentively
listened till such time as the sound by little and little went
from them, Eugenius, lifting up his head, and taking notice of it,
was the first who congratulated to the rest that happy omen of
our nation&#8217;s victory: adding, that we had but this to desire in
confirmation of it, that we might hear no more of that noise,
which was now leaving the English coast.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>This fine induction can hardly have formed part of the
original essay, which, Dryden tells us, was written in the
country in 1665, since the naval battle, which was fought
on June 3rd, 1665, is described as having taken place in
&#8216;the first summer of the late war.&#8217; One extraordinary
passage must have been left uncorrected by oversight, at
least we cannot well suppose that Dryden would have
printed &#8216;Blank verse is acknowledged to be too low for a
poem&#8217; after the appearance of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, which was
published on the day after the conclusion of the Peace of
Breda, not then known in England. The essay has two
objects not very compatible: to defend the English stage
against the French, and to advocate the use of rhyme
in tragedy, which necessarily gives the piece a French air,
and makes it appear imitative, when it is in truth original.
Dryden points out with considerable force the restrictions
which French dramatists of the classical school impose
upon themselves by servile adherence to the unities of time
and place, and in a well-known passage which does honour
to his taste sets Shakespeare above Ben Jonson. His
criticism of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, in his essay on <i>The
Grounds of Criticism in Tragedy</i> (1679), is instructive as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
illustrating by force of contrast that enlarged view of
Shakespeare for which we are indebted to Goethe and
Coleridge. He justly censures <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> as a
play; it does not occur to him that Shakespeare may have
intended a satire. All his essays, which consist principally
of prefaces and dedications to his own works, are worth
reading; none more so than his defence of Virgil in the
dedication to his translation of his poems, and the remarks
on Horace and Juvenal in his <i>Essay on Satire</i>. Everywhere
we must admire his sanity, penetration, and massive
common sense; his chief defects are conventional prejudice,
negligence (as when he ascribes the invention of
blank verse to Shakespeare), and the parade of second-hand
learning. It may be said of his criticisms, as truly
as of his poems or plays, that his merits are his own, his
faults those of his age.</p>

<p>Another critic of the stage only deserves notice in this
capacity from his connection with Dryden. Thomas Rymer
(1639-1714) will be mentioned again as a meritorious antiquary.
As a critic he is remarkable for having by his <i>Tragedies
of the Last Age</i> (1673) drawn some judicious remarks
from Dryden, and for having analyzed <i>Othello</i> as a pattern
of a bad play. He has consequently been unanimously
hooted by his countrymen, for it passes belief that Pope
should have praised him to Spence, though Spence affirms
it. It was his misfortune to be an Englishman; in France
at the time his views would have been thought very correct;
in fact, he criticises Shakespeare much in the style of Voltaire.
He is a votary of decorum and dignity, and would
no more than Voltaire have let a mouse into a tragedy. He
discusses with imperturbable gravity, &#8216;Who and who may
kill one another with decency?&#8217; and decides, &#8216;In poetry no
woman is to kill a man, except her quality gives her the
advantage above him. Poetical decency will not suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
death to be dealt to each other by such persons, whom the
laws of duel allow not to enter the lists together.&#8217; And
Rymer would have been content to have dwelt in such
decencies for ever.</p>

<p>Jeremy Collier, a Nonjuring clergyman (1650-1726),
attained fame, not as the advocate of decencies, but of decency.
His <i>Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness
of the English Stage</i> (1698) occasioned a great sensation,
and was efficacious in abating the evils against which it
was directed, although it is probable that Addison&#8217;s mild
rebuke and better example accomplished even more. As
the adversary of men of wit and genius, Collier has become
obnoxious to their representatives, and has been
unfairly reviled as a sour fanatic. In fact he is very
moderate, admits that the stage may be a valuable medium
of instruction, and only denounces its abuse. Scott and
Macaulay have done him justice, and Mr. Gosse gives an
excellent analysis of his work in his biography of Congreve.
His wit is as unquestionable as his zeal, but his argument
is not everywhere equally cogent. On the chapter of profaneness
he is fantastic and straitlaced, and so tender of
dignities that he will not allow even the god Apis to be
disrespectfully mentioned. On that of immorality he is
unanswerable, and unless the incriminated dramatists were
prepared to say, &#8216;Evil, be thou my good,&#8217; they could but
own</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Et dici potuisse, et non potuisse refelli.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Congreve and Vanbrugh attempted to reply, but to little
purpose. Dryden kissed the rod. Collier&#8217;s volume is said
to have been &#8216;conceived, disposed, transcribed, and printed
in a month.&#8217; He had previously achieved notoriety as a
Jacobite pamphleteer, and in his old age became the
official head of the decaying sect of the Nonjurors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Richard Bentley (1662-1743) belongs mainly
to the eighteenth century, his dissertation upon the <i>Epistles
of Phalaris</i> (1699) falls within the seventeenth, and an
account of the literary criticism of this age would be incomplete
without some mention of the one epoch-making
critical work it produced. There is no need to tell again
the story of the Bentley-Boyle controversy, so admirably
narrated by Macaulay and Jebb; but it may be observed
here that it marks an era in criticism as the first example
of the testimony of antiquity being irretrievably overthrown
by internal evidence. It was not the first time
that the genuineness of attested ancient writings had been
disputed. Valla had waged war upon the forged donation
of Constantine, but his case was so very clear that he
had not been answered, but as far as possible ignored.
Phalaris had found defenders, and this controversy was
perhaps the first in which tradition and authority were
fairly vanquished in a pitched battle. Bentley&#8217;s extraordinary
powers of mind were almost equally evinced in
his <i>Boyle Lectures</i>, also a production of the seventeenth
century, which will be noticed in their place.</p>

<span class="smaller">PHILOSOPHY.</span></h2>

<p>From the criticism of books we pass, by no violent transition,
to the criticism of principles&mdash;moral science. The
latter half of the seventeenth century is a distinguished
period in the history of English philosophy, for in it the
most distinctively national of all systems which have obtained
currency in this country was fully formulated. It
is remarkable that while both empirical and transcendental
views in philosophy found supporters, the champions of
the latter comprised several illustrious names, and that of
the former only one, while nevertheless empiricism obtained
as complete a triumph as has ever been recorded in the
history of opinion. The principal reason, no doubt, is the
natural attractiveness to the solid homely understanding
of the Englishman of conclusions based on experience and
common sense;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but partly also to the fact that the illustrious
man by whom the empirical philosophy was mainly
upheld carried his speculations into practical life, and became
foremost among the defenders of civil and religious
liberty. If Locke, like his forerunner Hobbes, had employed
his acuteness in defence of absolute power, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
would, like Hobbes, have been caressed by the court, but
his doctrines would have been slighted by the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Locke
(1632-1704).</div>

<p>John Locke was born at Wrington in the north of
Somerset, August 29 (N.S.), 1632, the same
year that gave birth to Spinoza. His father,
an attorney, was a man of independent character
and strong principle, which he proved by accepting
a commission in a Parliamentary regiment. Locke was
elected to a foundation scholarship at Westminster in
1647, and to a studentship at Christ Church in 1652. He
became M.A. in June, 1658, was appointed Greek Lecturer
in 1660, and held other college offices. He wrote about
this time two treatises as yet unpublished, one upon the
Roman commonwealth, the other on the right of the civil
magistrate to regulate indifferent matters touching the
exercise of religion, which, under the influence of the hopes
which moderate men entertained of the Restoration government,
he was at the time inclined to allow. Having determined
to study medicine, he obtained in 1666 a dispensation
to enable him to hold his studentship, and in the same
year the decisive bias was given to his life by his acquaintance
with Shaftesbury, of whose family he became virtually
a member in the following year. Shaftesbury was as yet
neither the Shaftesbury of the Cabal nor the Shaftesbury
of the Popish Plot, and there was no reason why Locke
should hesitate in attaching himself to a statesman, who,
whatever his astuteness and versatility, possessed by far the
most enlightened and comprehensive mind of any public
man of his day. The main bond which united the two
was their agreement on the principle of toleration, for
which Chillingworth had been denounced and Roger
Williams persecuted, and which scarcely any one would
then have subscribed as an abstract proposition, though
Cromwell had gone a long way towards reducing it to prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>tice.
Influenced probably by Shaftesbury, Locke drew up in
1667 an <i>Essay on Toleration</i>, the first draft of his subsequent
celebrated work, and which has itself been retrieved
from oblivion by Mr. Fox Bourne. Considering the circumstances
of the times, it can excite neither surprise nor
censure that he should have argued in favour of denying
the privileges of toleration to those who denied them to
others, <i>i.e.</i>, to Roman Catholics. Two years later he drew
up, at Shaftesbury&#8217;s instance, a constitution for the colony
of Carolina, in which Shaftesbury was largely interested.
His medical skill was exerted in relieving Shaftesbury from
the effects of a serious complaint; and he acquitted himself
successfully in a yet more delicate undertaking, the choosing
a wife for his son. He also attended professionally at the
birth of Shaftesbury&#8217;s grandson, the future author of
<i>Characteristics</i>. These services were fitly recompensed by
secretaryships, both at the Great Seal and at the Board of
Trade, but there is not the slightest proof of his having
participated in any of his patron&#8217;s plots; while it is not too
much to say that the steady regard entertained for Shaftesbury
by a man like Locke affords the strongest of all
presumptions that this enigmatical personage was, after
all, a patriot. During three and a half stormy years Locke
was in France for the benefit of his health, making observations
on the culture of the vine and olive, and noting,
under the external splendour of Louis XIV.&#8217;s reign,
symptoms of that distress among the industrial classes
which was to issue in the Revolution. Returning, he
found his patron just liberated from the Tower, and their
intimate relations continued until Shaftesbury&#8217;s flight
to Holland in November, 1682, followed by his death in
the succeeding January. Locke was thus a mark for the
suspicions and animosities of the triumphant Court party.
His usual place of residence was now Oxford, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
still enjoyed his Christ Church studentship, and curious
letters are extant from Dean Prideaux, avowing practices
akin to espionage, but admitting that John Locke is so
close a man, and his servant such a ph&oelig;nix of discretion,
that nothing can be made out. Locke wisely withdrew to
Holland about the autumn of 1683, and in November, 1684,
was arbitrarily ejected from his studentship by a royal
mandate. He employed his exile in forming friendships
with Limborch, Le Clerc, and other distinguished men,
in composing his famous <i>Letter on Toleration</i>, published
anonymously in 1689, and in active communication with
William and Mary when the Deliverer&#8217;s expedition was
finally determined upon. He came to England with
Mary in 1689, and received the most flattering offers of
important diplomatic posts, which he declined on account of
the weakness of his health. He accepted, however, a small
appointment, but his principal public services were rendered
as a referee on the various important questions submitted
to him by Government; and as a man of letters, having
nearly reached the age of sixty without publishing anything
of importance, he produced within ten years the series of
unadorned tracts which have made him, alike in the regions
of philosophy and of politics, the most conspicuous representative
of masculine, unimaginative, English common
sense.</p>

<p>The <i>Letter on Toleration</i>, as already mentioned, had
appeared anonymously in Holland in 1689. In 1690 the
<i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i> was published, and
also the two <i>Treatises on Government</i>; the first, a reply to
Filmer, the advocate of divine right, composed, in Professor
Fowler&#8217;s opinion, between 1680 and 1685; the
second written during the last years of Locke&#8217;s residence in
Holland. The <i>Letter on Toleration</i>, the authorship of
which was not acknowledged during Locke&#8217;s lifetime, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
followed by three defences against assailants, two of which
appeared respectively in 1690 and 1692, the third was
posthumous. The <i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i>,
adopted from the first as a text-book at Trinity College,
Dublin, but ineffectually proscribed in the writer&#8217;s own
university, called forth criticisms from Norris of Bemerton,
to which Locke replied in two essays allowed to remain
unpublished during his life, &#8216;for,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I love not controversy.&#8217;
He could not, however, avoid a controversy with
John Edwards and Bishop Stillingfleet, on his <i>Reasonableness
of Christianity</i> (1695). After writing five pamphlets,
Locke ultimately remained in possession of the field, the
drift of opinion being entirely in his favour, though few of
the official ministers of religion ventured to come forward
openly in his defence. The <i>Treatise on Education</i> (1693),
written at the request of William Molyneux, excited comparatively
little controversy. Another very important class
of the productions of his affluent maturity were those on
trade and finance, by which he rendered the utmost service
to the state. By his <i>Considerations on the Value of Money</i>
(1691), and other tracts, he contributed largely to the
reform of the currency, the condition of which had become
intolerable, but was in great danger of being corrected by
remedies worse than the disease. Several other publications
contributed to disseminate enlightened views on trade,
manufactures, and the interest of money. He could not
always be right; it is both painful and ludicrous to find
so wise and good a man obliged <i>ex officio</i> as a Commissioner
of Trade to find reasons for discouraging the woollen manufacture
in Ireland; which Swift seems to ridicule in describing
the Laputan philosophers who had devised means
to remove the wool from a sheep&#8217;s back, and hoped shortly
to propagate the breed of naked sheep over the kingdom.
This, nevertheless, is but a slight inconsistency with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
general tenor of Locke&#8217;s views on economical subjects,
which, no less than his political and religious convictions,
tended irresistibly towards unrestricted freedom. In 1700
he was released from public life, and spent his few remaining
years undisturbed by controversy, in the society of the
amiable family of Sir Francis Masham, of High Laver,
Essex, of whose house he had long been an inmate. Lady
Masham, singularly enough, was the daughter of Ralph
Cudworth, the great English champion of the ideal school
of philosophy, and therefore as far removed as possible
from Locke in opinion. He died on October 28, 1704.</p>

<p>Locke&#8217;s intellectual character must be considered along
with his writings; of his moral character it may justly
be said, that no English writer of equal eminence stands
so high. Butler and Berkeley may have been equally
faultless, and the latter, no doubt, possessed more of the
spell of personal fascination; but neither was, like Locke,
exposed to the storms of a corrupt and factious age;
neither was called upon to encounter such perils and make
such sacrifices; neither had the same opportunity of exercising
fortitude in adversity and moderation in success.
Whether as public patriot or private friend, Locke appears &#8216;a
spirit without spot,&#8217; and his resolute temper, his intellectual
ardour, and his brilliant achievements, effectually preserve
him from the insipidity which so frequently mars the
moral physiognomies of good men. His countenance,
indeed, is not illumined by the spirituality of a Channing;
but the robuster virtues stand forth in even bolder relief,
and his apparent exemption from the minor failings which
beset even a Newton, is the more remarkable as he wanted
neither for enemies nor biographers.</p>

<p>Locke&#8217;s great work as a philosopher is the <i>Essay on the
Human Understanding</i>, &#8216;the best chart of the human
mind,&#8217; says Hallam, one of the great representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
books of the world. In Locke, as in his predecessor
Hobbes, were united two endowments rarely combined, the
sturdy prosaic common sense of the man of the world and
the dexterity and subtlety of the practised logician. In his
utter antipathy to everything in the slightest degree illumined,
or, as he would have thought, distorted, by the
glamour of imagination or fancy, Locke was the true
representative of his age, and no subsequent change of
mental attitude, as the world sweeps on into new and
more genial climates of thought, can deprive his work
of its representative historical importance. Nor is this
all. Locke&#8217;s treatise was almost the first investigation
of the mind which took note of facts, and was not
purely metaphysical. It was also the first in which this
study took a leading place. &#8216;The science which we now
call Psychology, or the study of mind,&#8217; says Dr. Fowler,
&#8216;had hitherto, amongst modern writers, been almost exclusively
subordinated to other branches of speculation.
Locke was the first of modern writers to attempt at once
an independent and a complete treatment of the phenomena
of the human mind, of their mutual relations, of
their causes and limits. This task he undertakes, not in
the dogmatic spirit of his predecessors, but in the critical
spirit which he may be said almost to have inaugurated.
And the effect of his candour on his first readers must
have been enhanced by the fact, not always favourable to
his precision, that, as far as he can, he throws aside the
technical terminology of the schools, and employs the language
current in the better kinds of ordinary literature
and the well-bred society of his time.&#8217; In fact, as was said
of Socrates, he brought philosophy down from heaven to
earth; and this service, and the great influence which his
work produced upon the future development of philosophy,
are perhaps stronger claims to permanent distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
than the merits of a theory which can never be overlooked,
but can never again command the almost universal
assent which it received in its own day. For the application
of physiology to psychological research, implicitly, at
all events, advocated by Locke, has produced results of
which neither he nor his opponents dreamed. The central
point of his philosophy is the denial of innate ideas; the
mind is to him a <i>tabula rasa</i>, a sheet of blank paper, and
all the ideas which have been thought inherent in it are
the result of experience. In a sense we now know this to
be true; but we also know this experience not to be the
experience of the individual, but of the race, or rather say
of sentient existence for ages inconceivably remote. It
follows that although Locke may be abstractedly right in
denying the possibility of the acquisition of ideas except
through experience, yet practically everyone comes into
the world with a host of ideas derived from his ancestors,
connate if not innate; and that, so far from the human
mind resembling a sheet of blank paper, it is more like a
palimpsest inscribed and reinscribed <i>ad infinitum</i>. It also
follows that the discrepancies of mankind respecting
points of morality do not, as Locke thought, disprove the
existence of an ideal rule of right, for everyone must
necessarily be born with inherited instincts by which such
a rule is more or less deflected or obscured. In fact,
Locke and his adversaries were both partly right and
partly wrong&mdash;one party in denying intuition, the other in
defining it. Neither had found, or at that period could
have found, the real key to the difficulty; but it is to the
immortal honour of Locke that all real advance in
psychology has been effected by working in his spirit of
observation and induction, rather than by the <i> priori</i>
method of his opponents. The third and fourth books of
the essay, <i>On Words</i> and <i>On Knowledge</i>, contain but little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
controversial matter, and are chiefly devoted to illustrating
the imperfection of human faculties, especially
language, the necessity for clear and definite conceptions,
and the countless impediments in the way of
truth.</p>

<p>Three others among Locke&#8217;s writings are regarded as
classical: <i>On the Reasonableness of Christianity</i>, and <i>On
Education</i>, and his <i>Letters on Toleration</i>. <i>The Reasonableness
of Christianity</i> (1695) is from one point of view an
endeavour to render Christianity reasonable by eliminating
its corruptions; from another an attempt to establish it
on the basis of fulfilled prophecy and miracle. In both
respects it was admirably adapted to the prevalent sentiment
of Locke&#8217;s own day, and, although warmly attacked
by Stillingfleet, exerted a great influence upon the theology
of the eighteenth century. In our time the point of view
has shifted so far as to expose Locke to the full weight of
Dr. Martineau&#8217;s terse criticism, &#8216;The affidavit has become
the brief.&#8217; Its historical importance, however, can never
be impaired, any more than that of the admirable <i>Letters
on Toleration</i>, which seem commonplace because they are now
esteemed irrefragable. It was otherwise in his own time,
and for long afterwards. Their principal literary defects
are that they are too polemical, and too long. Of all
Locke&#8217;s works, <i>Some Thoughts concerning Education</i> is
perhaps the most universally approved, and it is in truth a
golden treatise, the very incarnation of good sense and
right feeling; and more useful in its own time than it can
be now that the errors which Locke especially assailed
have become contrary, instead of congenial, to the general
spirit of the age. The prevailing tone, the confidence in
human nature rightly treated, the abhorrence of the
merely arbitrary and despotic, render the work an epoch
in the history of culture, and, compared with the coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
maxims of a Defoe, or even the <i>Whole Duty of Man</i>&#8217;s
exclusive reliance upon authority, show how greatly Locke
was beyond his contemporaries in enlightenment and the
genuine spirit of humanity. The insight and penetration
into children&#8217;s characters are surprising in a man who had
no children of his own, or much direct concern with the
education of the children of others. They prove that
Locke must have been a most careful and accurate
observer. If there is a fault in the treatise, it is that the
range of view is not always sufficiently wide, and that the
author&#8217;s precepts are too exclusively propounded with
reference to the individual, and too little with a view to
the general advantage of society. The disuse of Latin
composition, for example, would have done little personal
harm to the majority of the individual boys of whom
Locke is thinking; but, in his day at all events, would
have lowered the standard of culture throughout Europe.
In general, however, Locke&#8217;s remarks are characterized by
the soundest common sense; and there is perhaps no
other production of the age so thoroughly in harmony
with its pervading spirit.</p>

<p>In sharp contrast to Locke and his school stand the
small knot of Cambridge Platonists and their allies&mdash;Cudworth,
Henry More, Culverwell, Cumberland, Glanvil,
and Whichcote, which last may indeed be regarded as a
connecting link between the rival thinkers. His place is
rather with the divines, and Henry More (1614-1657)
belongs more properly to the period of Vaughan in
virtue of his poetry, though continuing to write to a
late date. Culverwell and Cumberland scarcely rank
in a literary history; so that the school is chiefly represented
by Ralph Cudworth (1617-1688). Cudworth&#8217;s
life was uneventful. One of those moderate
men whom the excesses of party provoke to opposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>tion,
he sided mainly with the Puritans during the
Civil War, but was no Puritan himself, and protested
energetically against Puritan disparagement of sweetness
and light. He had no difficulty in conforming to the
Restoration, and accepting a living from Archbishop
Sheldon, but his life was mainly spent in his study, in the
production of vast folios, where the ingots of philosophy
lay stored while Locke&#8217;s current coin passed nimbly from
hand to hand. The contrast between the men and the
systems is complete at every point; and it is assuredly
one of the strangest ironies of fate that Cudworth&#8217;s
daughter should have become the good angel of Locke&#8217;s
old age. Cudworth is no doubt by much the more attractive
figure to imaginative minds; but it must be conceded
as an indisputable truth that his way of thinking could
not possibly have produced nearly so much good, have so
profoundly leavened men&#8217;s ideas on legislation and education,
or have so contributed to build up the national character
for sound common sense. This admitted, Cudworth
may be heartily praised as a sublime and refined thinker,
epithets inappropriate to Locke. His great work is <i>The
Intellectual System</i>, published in 1678, only the first part
of which ever appeared. A <i>Treatise on Immutable Morality</i>
remained in manuscript until 1731. Cudworth&#8217;s purpose
may briefly be defined as the expulsion of all materialistic
and mechanical notions from theology, metaphysics, and
ethics. He wages war upon atheism, fatalism, utilitarianism,
whatsoever is opposed to elevating and poetical
conceptions of the order of things. His erudition is only
too extensive, and he is very candid. Dryden thought
that he had stated the atheistic objections more powerfully
than he had answered them; and his doctrine of
plastic force in nature verges upon Pantheism, as indeed
religious philosophies usually do. He is finely analyzed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
in the <i>Types of Ethical Theory</i> of Dr. Martineau, who
says of his philosophy:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Embodied as it is in unfinished books, and buried in massive
erudition, it has been distantly respected rather than closely
studied; and has left upon few readers an adequate impression
of the depth of the author&#8217;s penetration, the comprehensiveness
of his grasp, the subtlety of his analysis, and the happy flashes of
expression by which he flings light upon real though unsuspected
relations.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Joseph Glanvil
(1636-1680).</div>

<p>Joseph Glanvil, although an Oxford man, practically
belonged to the group of Cambridge Platonists,
and was especially connected with
Henry More. He is the author of two very
dissimilar books, <i>The Vanity of Dogmatizing</i> (1660), and
<i>Saducismus Triumphatus</i> (1681), published after his death
with additions by More, Horneck, and others. The former
book, though containing no evidence of original power of
thought, is remarkable as an evidence of the influence of
Bacon in overthrowing the authority of Aristotle; for its
idolatry of Descartes; for its many curious anticipations (not
originating with Glanvil) of modern discoveries; above all,
for its testimony of the ardent scientific curiosity then fermenting
in England, and about to issue in the establishment
of the Royal Society. &#8216;Methinks,&#8217; Glanvil says, &#8216;this age
seems resolved to bequeath posterity something to remember
it.&#8217; The following is a remarkable passage to have been
written six years before Newton&#8217;s great discovery: &#8216;That
heavy bodies descend by gravity, is no better an account
than we might expect from a rustic; and again, that gravity
is a quality whereby a heavy body descends, is an impertinent
circle, and teacheth nothing.&#8217; The other and much more
celebrated work, on the other hand, is a most melancholy
example of superstitious credulity, but full of striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
stories of the supernatural. The contrast between the
styles of the two books is instructive; the earlier might
have been written in the days of James I.; the later,
though still antiquated, is much nearer modern English
prose.</p>

<span class="smaller">WRITERS ON GOVERNMENT.</span></h2>

<p>The hinge of the controversies on government which
agitated England in the seventeenth century, and produced
the great treatises of Locke and Algernon Sidney, was a
feeble book by Sir Robert Filmer, a Cavalier, written about
the end of the Civil War, but published at a period which
brings it within the scope of this volume. Filmer, though
not a man of conspicuous mental power, was able to discern
that the right of the nation to resist the arbitrary encroachments
of Charles I. could not well be disputed so long as
it continued to be held that &#8216;Mankind is naturally endowed
and born with freedom from all subjection, and at liberty
to choose what form of government it please, and that
the power which any one man hath over others was at first
bestowed according to the discretion of the multitude.&#8217;
This opinion, which he admits to be that generally held,
he endeavours to overthrow by the argument that no man
was ever born in a state of freedom, for everyone comes
into the world subject to the authority of his parents.
&#8216;Not only Adam, but the succeeding patriarchs had, by
right of fatherhood, royal authority over their children.&#8217;
How they came to have royal authority over the children
of other patriarchs Filmer does not explain; and it seems
obvious on his own showing that either this latter authority
does not exist, in which case there must be as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
monarchies as families, or that it exists in virtue of a
mutual contract among individual families; so that royal
authority derives from the people after all. Illogical, however,
as Filmer might be, his views were too agreeable to
the Court and to the supporters of absolute power not to
find much encouragement, and men of first-rate powers
found it necessary to take the field against them. Seldom
indeed has a writer of such slender abilities made so much
stir, or unintentionally laid the cause of liberty and reason
under such deep obligations. As a measure of his own
qualifications, it is sufficient to state that he seriously
takes Samuel&#8217;s dissuasion of the Israelites from setting up
a monarchy on the ground of the oppressions to which they
would subject themselves, for a luminous exposition of the
rights of the sovereign and the duties of the subject.</p>

<p>Filmer was answered by three writers of great distinction&mdash;Locke,
Algernon Sidney, and the Rev. George
Johnson, a memorable pamphleteer who scarcely vindicates
a place for himself in literature. The merit of their
polemic, and the obligation under which it has placed
posterity, must of necessity be ill appreciated by an age
which finds it difficult to believe that Filmer could ever be
thought to require an answer. The propositions that the
first man was invested by Heaven with monarchical privileges,
and that these privileges had in some manner devolved
on King Charles I., seem to us so palpably absurd
that Locke himself appears chargeable with folly for having
spent his time in refuting them. The steady intellectual
upheaval which has been going on ever since the revival of
letters has lifted us into a region where the conceptions of
divine right and non-resistance cannot live; and we are inclined
to attribute to the improvement of our understandings
what really proceeds from the alteration of our
environment. Ideas as baseless as Filmer&#8217;s are now daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
advanced, and daily combated by opponents whose services
will one day be requited by the neglect that has overtaken
Locke. Had Locke been a wit, he might indeed have immortalized
himself and his antagonist together; but
although he can and does make the latter ridiculous, he
cannot make him amusing. There is more vitality in the
second of his two <i>Tracts on Government</i>, for this in part
deals with speculative questions regarding the origin of
civil society as yet unsettled, and therefore not as yet commonplace.
Locke deduces the mutual relations and obligations
of rulers and ruled from a contract which he supposes
to have been entered into in the infancy of society. The
theory was highly salutary for the age, abolishing all superstitious
notions of divine right, and providing sufficient
justification for popular resistance to evil rulers. It must
be owned, however, that it lacked the only safe basis of
theory, the historical; the constitutions of uncivilized man
were little known in Locke&#8217;s day, and the better known they
have become the less affinity they have seemed to present
to the parliament which his imagination transported back
from Westminster to Shinar. His essay nevertheless represents
a necessary phase in the development of opinion, and
exerted the most beneficial influence in generating the enlightened
political sentiment of the eighteenth century.
It is amusing to remark that, in spite of the Israelites,
Locke stoutly refuses his imaginary society the right to
contract itself out of its freedom by establishing an absolute
monarchy, the only form of government which,
according to his opponents, could be legitimate in any
sense.</p>

<p>Algernon Sidney&#8217;s <i>Discourse on Government</i> has attracted
less attention than Locke&#8217;s, mainly because it claims more.
So elaborate and ambitious a work was not required to
crush Filmer, who had in fact been crushed by Locke some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
years before the appearance of Sidney&#8217;s belated refutation.
It is nevertheless a more interesting work than Locke&#8217;s,
partly from the fineness of the style, a noble specimen of
dignified though vehement English prose, partly from the
reflection of the striking personality of the author, &#8216;a
Roman in un-Roman times.&#8217; Though a patrician both on
the father&#8217;s and the mother&#8217;s side, Sidney was theoretically
a republican. Born in 1622, second son of the Earl of
Leicester, he had served the Commonwealth in the Civil
War, and distinguished himself afterwards by his resistance
to what he deemed the usurpation of Cromwell. The
Restoration found him envoy to the northern courts.
Exchanging embassy for exile, he remained abroad until
1677, when he returned under an engagement to live
quietly. Whether he had any actual concern in the Rye
House plot is one of the problems of history; certain it is
that no good evidence was produced, and that he was
iniquitously condemned on the testimony of one witness of
infamous character, and of papers in his handwriting
written years before. These seem to have formed part of
a brief reply to Filmer, never published; the stately work
that has come down to us was written after the publication
of Filmer&#8217;s manuscript in 1680, and was evidently
prompted by the debates on the Exclusion Bill. The
style precisely corresponds to the author&#8217;s character,
haughty, fiery, and arrogant; but thrilling with conviction,
and meriting the highest praise as a specimen of
masculine, nervous, and at the same time polished English.
Much additional zest is imparted to the author&#8217;s argument
by his continual strokes at the political abuses and the
unworthy characters of his own day, from Charles II.
downwards. He had the advantage of writing under the
stimulus of fiery indignation kindled and maintained by
the actual existence of a tyranny. He is thus never tame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and depicts himself as one of that remarkable class of men
of whom Alfieri is perhaps the most characteristic type&mdash;aristocrats
by temperament, champions of democracy by
intellectual conviction.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Although the controversy in
which he engaged now belongs entirely to the past, he is
often modern in sentiment as well as in style; sometimes
we are reminded of Shelley, at other times, and more
frequently, of Landor. It certainly indicates some want
of good sense to have written so grandiose a reply to a
tract so diminutive in every point of view, and most will
be contented with his biographer&#8217;s, Miss Blackburne&#8217;s,
excellent analysis. As a fine writer, however, Sidney has
a right to a place in any collection of Restoration prose:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;No man can be my judge, unless he be my superior; and he
cannot be my superior, who is not so by my consent, nor to any
other purpose than I consent to. This cannot be the case of a
nation, which can have no equal within itself. Controversies
may arise with other nations, the decision of which may be left
to judges chosen by mutual agreement; but this relates not to
our question. A nation, and especially one that is powerful,
cannot recede from its own right, as a private man, from the
knowledge of his own weakness, and inability to defend himself,
must come under the protection of a greater power than his
own. The strength of a nation is not in the magistrate, but the
strength of the magistrate is in the nation. The wisdom, industry,
and valour of a prince may add to the glory and greatness
of a nation, but the foundation and substance will always be in
itself. If the magistrate and people were upon equal terms, as
Caius and Sejus, receiving equal and mutual advantages from
each other, no man could be judge of their differences, but such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
as they should set up for that end. This has been done by
many nations. The ancient Germans referred the decision of
the most difficult matters to their priests; the Gauls and Britons
to the Druids; the Mahometans for some ages to the caliphs of
Babylon; the Saxons in England, when they had embraced the
Christian religion, to their clergy. Whilst all Europe lay under
the popish superstition, the decision of such matters was frequently
assumed by the pope: men often submitted to his
judgment, and the princes that resisted were for the most part
excommunicated, deposed and destroyed. All this was done for
the same reasons. These men were accounted holy and inspired,
and the sentence pronounced by them was usually reverenced as
the judgment of God, who was thought to direct them; and all
those who refused to submit were esteemed execrable. But no
man or number of men, as I think, at the institution of a magistrate,
did ever say, if any difference happen between you or
your successors and us, it shall be determined by yourself, or by
them, whether they be men, women, children, mad, foolish, or
vicious. Nay, if any such thing had been, the folly, turpitude,
and madness of such a sanction or stipulation must necessarily
have destroyed it. But if no such thing was ever known, or
could have no effect, if it had been in any place, it is most
absurd to impose it upon all. The people therefore cannot be
deprived of their natural rights upon a frivolous pretence to
that which never was, and never can be. They who create
magistracies, and give to them such name, form, and power, as
they think fit, do only know, whether the end for which they
were created be performed or not. They who give a being to
the power which had none can only judge, whether it be employed
to their welfare, or turned to their ruin. They do not
set up one or a few men, that they and their posterity may live
in splendour and greatness, but that justice may be administered,
virtue established, and provision made for the public safety.
No wise man will think this can be done, if those who set themselves
to overthrow the law are to be their own judges.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir William Temple, in an essay on government written
in 1672, arrives at substantially the same conclusion as
Sidney by a different path. Fletcher of Saltoun, the illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>trious
Scottish patriot, wrote <i>An Account of a Conversation
for a right Regulation of Governments</i> (1704).</p>

<p>The development of the English periodical press during
the Restoration epoch is a matter of such moment that the
two men principally connected with it cannot be left unnoticed,
although, at least in one instance, their claim
to rank as men of letters is very slender. Marchamont
Needham (1620-1678) had scarcely any other character
than that of a pamphleteer who only escaped the designation
of hired scribbler by his political infidelities and a certain
rough effectiveness in his ephemeral writings. This &#8216;most
seditious, mutable, and railing author&#8217;s&#8217; position in the
history of the press is nevertheless important; for if not
the first strictly professional journalist, he is the first whose
name has descended to posterity. Having from 1641 to
1647 made war against the king in his <i>Mercurius Britannicus</i>,
he changed sides and wrote as a royalist in <i>Mercurius
Pragmaticus</i>, recanted again and supported Cromwell
as the conductor of <i>Mercurius Politicus</i>; and, after a
short exile, ultimately made his peace with the Restoration.
He had already excited the animosity of the stricter Puritans,
one of whom thus anticipated and refuted the best
plea that could be made for him: &#8216;He is a man of
parts, and hath a notable vein of writing. Doubtless so
hath the Devil; must therefore the Devil be made use
of?&#8217; He subsequently made war upon schoolmasters and
physicians, and died suddenly as he was about returning
to his old trade of political pamphleteer. Roger L&#8217;Estrange
(1616-1704) was a man of much higher character, being a
consistent royalist. His connection with the periodical
press in Charles II.&#8217;s day was brief, lasting only from
1663 to 1666, when his <i>Intelligencer</i> and <i>News</i> were extinguished
by the appearance of an official journal, the <i>Oxford</i>,
afterwards the <i>London Gazette</i>. But he has a permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
place in history as the first &#8216;able editor,&#8217; who not only
made his journal the vehicle for political discussions, and
availed himself of regular news-letters, but employed a
regular staff of assistants to collect news. He was no
friend to his own trade, for he says in a prospectus: &#8216;Supposing
the press in order, the people in their right wits,
and news or no news to be the question, a public Mercury
should never have my vote, because I think it makes the
multitude too familiar with the actions and counsels of
their superiors, too pragmatical and censorious, and gives
them not only a wish but a kind of colourable right and
licence to the meddling with the government.&#8217; A man
who thought thus must have seemed admirably qualified
for the office of licenser of the press, which he held from
1663 to the Revolution, and in the discharge of which he
inevitably accumulated the odium which even now somewhat
undeservedly rests upon his memory. In 1681 he
returned to newspaper editing, and successfully carried on
<i>Heraclitus Ridens</i> and <i>The Observator</i> until March, 1687,
when James II., who was enacting liberty of conscience
to serve his own ends, silenced the old Cavalier just as the
latter was demonstrating this liberty to be &#8216;a paradox
against law, reason, nature, and religion.&#8217; L&#8217;Estrange&#8217;s
prose style is bad, but he was the author of several useful
translations, of which those from sop, Josephus,
Quevedo, and Erasmus are the best known. He was a
courtly and well-bred man, of considerable culture, and
would be mentioned with more respect if he had not exercised
a function detestable to the entire republic of letters.
Dr. Johnson regarded him as the first writer upon record
who regularly enlisted himself under the banners of a party
for pay, and fought for it through right and wrong. This
is probably correct as a mere statement of fact, but unjust
if it was intended to imply any doubt of the purity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
L&#8217;Estrange&#8217;s motives in serving the high monarchical
party, or of the sincerity of his advocacy of its principles.</p>

<p>The <i>Political Arithmetic</i> of Sir William Petty (1623-1687),
and the <i>Discourse of Trade</i> of Sir Josiah Child
(1630-1699), take high rank among economic publications,
but can scarcely be regarded as literature.</p>

<span class="smaller">HISTORIES AND MEMOIRS OF PUBLIC TRANSACTIONS.</span></h2>

<p>History is one of the departments of literature in
which it is easiest to approach the unsurpassable perfection
of antiquity. Poets must in general be accepted
as inspiring influences rather than as models; but the
methods of historians may be studied and even copied
without undue servility. This was soon perceived by the
Latin races, and by the middle of the seventeenth century
the vernacular literatures of Italy, Spain, and Portugal
possessed many truly classical historians. It is difficult
to understand why England should have been so backward.
The Restoration found its historical literature in
an intermediate stage, half way between the artless old
chroniclers and the consummate examples of historical
style and construction which the next century was to produce.
It left historical composition, however, much more
advanced than it had found it. The chief history of the
age, though far from perfect, at all events was a history
and not a chronicle. Clarendon&#8217;s great work, it is true,
belongs to the preceding generation in everything but the
date of its composition; and will, accordingly, be found
to be treated in a previous section of this history. His
successor, Burnet, on the other hand, was in literary matters
a perfect representative of his own day, a man of his times;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and their works taken together, while illustrating the mutations
of taste and the gradual popularization of culture,
may be regarded as the Iliad and Odyssey of the period,
the former a high epical treatment of a tragic theme,
decreed by the Fates and directed by the Gods; the second
a bustling tragi-comedy true to human nature and crowded
with domestic incident. The writers, moreover, have these
things in common: that both are men of original and
marked character, whose personality is vividly embodied in
their productions; that both had been busy actors in many
of the events which they detail; that both, therefore, had
unusual means of information, and the narrative of neither
could miss the liveliness imparted by actual contact with
the transactions they relate. Both were inevitably prejudiced,
but both were high-minded and conscientious; and
the bias against which they vainly contended is too visible
and too much a matter of course to detract seriously from
the value of their histories.</p>

<p>Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, was born at
Edinburgh, September 18th, 1643. By the wish of his
father he selected the Church as his profession, which
placed him in the invidious position of an Episcopalian
ministering amid a nation of Presbyterians. His moderation,
nevertheless, gained the confidence of the dissidents,
and his great influence with Lauderdale, the ruler of
Scotland, was exerted in favour of the most conciliatory
measures and the widest toleration possible. When at
length Lauderdale had become hopelessly committed to
a violent course, Burnet withdrew from Scotland, and
settled in London as preacher at the Rolls and at St.
Clement Danes. During Charles&#8217;s reign, though an object
of great suspicion to the court, he maintained his ground,
but at the accession of James found it expedient to
go abroad. After travelling in France, and proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
as far as Rome, he settled in Holland, returning with
William III. in 1688. William&#8217;s proclamation was drafted
by him, and he drew up the engagement signed by
the nobility who joined the prince. These and many
other services were rewarded by the bishopric of Salisbury,
where, by the confession of his adversaries, he proved
as charitable and exemplary a prelate as the Church had
ever seen. He is especially memorable in this capacity as
the author of the scheme for the augmentation of poor
livings commonly known as Queen Anne&#8217;s Bounty. He
died in 1715. His moral character was of the highest;
his intellectual character was disfigured by some foibles,
unimportant in themselves, but which, not being of the
kind usually found in conjunction with first-rate abilities,
have occasioned his powers to be considerably undervalued.
The man, however, who was respected by the
cynical Charles and trusted by the jealous William,
cannot have been of ordinary mould; nor can it be
said of many authors that they have produced three
books which, after the lapse of two centuries, are still
regarded as standard authorities. The <i>History of the
Reformation</i> was published in 1679-1714; the <i>Exposition
of the Articles</i> in 1699; the <i>History of his Own Times</i> in
1723-34.</p>

<p>Burnet&#8217;s <i>History of his Own Times</i> actually deserves the
character which Clarendon incorrectly gives of his own; it
is rather the material for history than history itself. This
is not a consequence of crude treatment, for all is well
arranged and lively, nor from the encumbrance of original
documents, of which it is nearly destitute. It arises rather
from the predominance of the autobiographic tone, much
more marked than in Clarendon, though Clarendon also
relates as an eyewitness, which almost brings the book
down to the level of personal memoirs. It must neverthe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>less
be classed with histories, and, if not one of the most
dignified, it is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining.
Burnet&#8217;s deep interest in the events in which he had taken
so large a share insures vivacious and effective treatment;
his personages breathe and move, and impress themselves
indelibly upon the reader&#8217;s imagination, though he usually
abstains from set efforts at the depicting of character. The
defects of his method are no less apparent; in relating
what he has not himself heard or seen, he relies upon
hearsay, and sinks into a gossip. The extent, nevertheless,
to which he speaks as an eyewitness, renders his work
very valuable. Well acquainted with Charles and James,
admitted to the favour of William and the full confidence
of Mary, he is able to introduce us into their presence, and
summon them as it were from the dead. His point of
view, being so largely personal, is inevitably partial; he
can tell us, for example, of the defects in Shaftesbury&#8217;s
character, which he discovered from actual acquaintance,
but nothing of the surprising enlightenment of the statesman,
which could only be learned from speeches which he
never heard and documents which he never saw. Impartiality
is the last virtue to be expected from a busy actor
in a troubled age, but Burnet approaches it as nearly as
can with any reason be demanded. It is hardly in human
nature that he should be entirely fair to adversaries by
whom he had himself been maligned, but his intention of
being so is very apparent. The most impartial and generally
the most valuable portion of his work is his narrative
up to the Revolution. When he wrote this, animosities
had become mellowed by time; when he lived it his contact
with affairs had been more intimate as the political agent
than afterwards as the spiritual peer. Disappointment
with the course of events colours his account of Anne&#8217;s
reign, and renders him splenetic and querulous. His per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>spicuous
and animated diction does not always attain the
dignity of history; he hardly ever attempts eloquence,
except in the noble and deeply-felt conclusion of his work,
a portion of which must be cited, although it is no fair
example of his ordinary style:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;So that by religion I mean, such a sense of divine truth as
enters into a man, and becomes a spring of a new nature within
him; reforming his thoughts and designs, purifying his heart,
and sanctifying him, and governing his whole deportment, his
words as well as his actions; convincing him that it is not enough,
not to be scandalously vicious, or to be innocent in his conversation,
but that he must be entirely, uniformly, and constantly,
pure and virtuous, animating him with a zeal to be still better
and better, more eminently good and exemplary, using prayers
and all outward devotions, as solemn acts testifying what he is
inwardly and at heart, and as methods instituted by God, to be
still advancing in the use of them further and further into a more
refined and spiritual sense of divine matters. This is true
religion, which is the perfection of human nature, and the joy
and delight of every one that feels it active and strong within
him: it is true, this is not arrived at all at once; and it will have
an unhappy alloy, hanging long even about a good man; but, as
those ill mixtures are the perpetual grief of his soul, so it is his
chief care to watch over and to mortify them; he will be in a
continual progress, still gaining ground upon himself; and as he
attains to a good degree of purity, he will find a noble flame of
life and joy growing upon him. Of this I write with the more
concern and emotion, because I have felt this the true, and indeed
the only joy which runs through a man&#8217;s heart and life: it is
that which has been for many years my greatest support; I
rejoice daily in it: I feel from it the earnest of that supreme joy
which I pant and long for; I am sure there is nothing else can
afford any true or complete happiness. I have, considering my
sphere, seen a great deal of all that is most shining and tempting
in this world: the pleasures of sense I did soon nauseate;
intrigues of state, and the conduct of affairs, have something in
them that is most specious; and I was for some years, deeply
immersed in these, but still with hopes of reforming the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and of making mankind wiser and better: but I have found that
which is crooked cannot be made straight. I acquainted myself
with knowledge and learning, and that in a great variety, and
with more compass than depth: but though wisdom excelleth
folly as much as light does darkness, yet as it is a sore travail,
so it is so very defective, that what is wanting to complete it
cannot be numbered. I have seen that two were better than
one, and that a threefold cord is not easily loosed; and have
therefore cultivated friendship with much zeal and a disinterested
tenderness; but I have found this was also vanity and vexation
of spirit, though it be of the best and noblest sort. So that,
upon great and long experience, I could enlarge on the preacher&#8217;s
text, &#8220;Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity,&#8221; but I must also conclude
with him; Fear God, and keep his commandments, for
this is the all of man, the whole, both of his duty and of his
happiness. I do therefore end all in the words of David, of the
truth of which, upon great experience and a long observation, I
am so fully assured, that I leave these as my last words to
posterity: &#8220;Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach
you the fear of the Lord. What man is he that desireth life, and
loveth many days, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from
evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and
do good; seek peace, and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are
upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry; but the
face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance
of them from the earth. The righteous cry, and the Lord
heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles. The Lord
is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as
be of a contrite spirit.&#8221;&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Burnet&#8217;s reputation as an historian also rests in considerable
measure upon another important work, his
<i>History of the Reformation in England</i>, published in 1679.
This great subject, frequently, variously, and never successfully
handled, may some day make a first-class reputation
for an historian as yet concealed in the future. That
a satisfactory history of it should be written in Burnet&#8217;s
day was impossible, and it was equally impossible that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
work should either exhibit the liveliness, or possess the
unique value of his <i>History of his Own Times</i>. The theme
is one for a graver and more eloquent historian than he,
capable of rising to greater heights, and wielding far more
absolute command over the resources of language. Nor
can his laborious collections from state papers and former
historians rival the importance of his narrative of transactions
in which he was a busy actor, full of particulars
only to be obtained from himself. With all these inevitable
imperfections, his <i>History of the Reformation</i> is still
an excellent book, eminently readable, just and accurate in
its broad views, however needing correction on points of
detail; and, considering that it was the work of a Scotch
Protestant writing in the thick of the Popish Plot, surprisingly
candid and impartial. It is of course the work
of a partisan, but he who does not feel sufficient interest
in the Reformation to be a partisan on one side or the
other is not likely to write its history at all, and had
better not. Probably no history of the English Reformation
has since been written that does not exhibit more
party feeling than Burnet&#8217;s, or that can reasonably claim
to supersede it.</p>

<p>Burnet&#8217;s <i>History of his Times</i>, as we have seen, may be
regarded as a connecting link between history and <i>mmoires
pour servir</i>. The age of Charles II. was favourable to this
latter class of composition, which is, indeed, the form
which the narrators of public transactions in which they
themselves have borne a leading part, naturally fall. The
period was still more fertile in the diary, which may be
defined as the autobiographic memoir in a rudimentary
stage. One writer of the day, Samuel Pepys, has placed
himself for all time at the head of this class of composition,
by an achievement little likely to be repeated.
Among memoir-writers proper the most important is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Edmund Ludlow, the Cato of the Commonwealth (1617-1692).</p>

<p>Ludlow, the son of a Wiltshire knight of extreme
political views, enlisted at the commencement of the Civil
War in the bodyguard of the Earl of Essex, and afterwards
highly distinguished himself by his obstinate, though
unsuccessful defence of Wardour Castle, in his native
county. He was made prisoner, exchanged, and took part
in several encounters in the West of England. Elected
member for Wiltshire, he sided with the more extreme
party, and was one of the king&#8217;s judges. He became a
member of the Council of State, and at the beginning of
1651 was sent to Ireland as second in authority to Ireton,
whom he assisted in completing the subjugation of the
country, and subsequently filled the same position under
Fleetwood. Bitterly opposed to Cromwell&#8217;s Protectorate,
he resigned his civil appointment, but contrived to retain
his military position until 1655, when, coming over to
England, he was arrested and imprisoned in Beaumaris
Castle. When at length he was admitted to an audience
of Cromwell, &#8216;What,&#8217; asked the Protector, &#8216;can you desire
more than you have?&#8217; &#8216;That which we fought for,&#8217;
replied Ludlow, &#8216;that the nation might be governed by its
own consent&#8217;&mdash;words which recall Augereau&#8217;s repartee to
Napoleon on the re-establishment of Roman Catholicism
in France. Ludlow was kept under surveillance until the
death of Cromwell, when he became exceedingly active,
and upon the abdication of Richard Cromwell was sent
again to Ireland in a position of authority. Returning, he
sought in vain to mediate between the Parliament and the
army, and distinguished himself in the Convention Parliament
by a vain protest against the Restoration. He fled
the country to avoid the vengeance of the new government,
and took refuge in Switzerland, where he composed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
memoirs, and abode in comfortable circumstances, although
occasionally molested by plots against his life or liberty,
until his death in 1692. The Revolution of 1688 had
brought him back to England for an instant, but the
public feeling against regicides was still too strong, and,
returning to his refuge at Vevay, he carved over his
door:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Omne solum forti patria quia Patris.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Ludlow was not one of the greatest or wisest characters
of his time, but is one of the most estimable in virtue of
his sturdy honesty. He was one of that hopelessly inconsistent
class of persons, the believers in the divine right of
a republic as the sole form of political institution consistent
with reason, who in the same breath assert and
take away the nation&#8217;s right to choose its own form of
government by forbidding its exercise unless the form
has the allowance of a theory impersonated in themselves.
On the principle of popular sovereignty, no form
of government could be more legitimate than the Restoration
monarchy, which, nevertheless, Ludlow was always
seeking to overthrow. Cromwell&#8217;s title was by no means
so clear, and Ludlow&#8217;s firm resistance to the Protector at
the height of his power, if proving his inability to
&#8216;swallow formulas,&#8217; and look solely to the public good, is
nevertheless most honourable to his courage and fortitude.
If inaccessible to reason, he was even more so to self-interest.
The historical value of his memoirs is very
great, especially for the troubled interval between Cromwell&#8217;s
death and the Restoration. Carlyle, Guizot, and
Firth unite in following him with implicit confidence when
he speaks as an eyewitness, when he relies upon others he
is frequently inaccurate and confused. The <i>Memoirs</i>
virtually commence with the outbreak of the Civil War, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
extend to 1672. The interest of the latter years is of
course mainly personal. The style is clear and unadorned.
The following passage is a good example of the writer&#8217;s
power of conveying antipathy by sarcasm:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Different were the effects that the death of Cromwell produced
in the nation: those men who had been sharers with him
in the usurped authority were exceedingly troubled, whilst all
other parties rejoiced at it: each of them hoping that this alteration
would prove advantageous to their affairs. The Commonwealthsmen
were so charitable to believe that the soldiery being
delivered from their servitude to the General, to which they
were willing to attribute their former compliance, would now
open their eyes and join with them, as the only means left to preserve
themselves and the people. Neither were the Cavaliers
without great hopes that new divisions might arise, and give them
an opportunity of advancing their minion, who had been long endeavouring
to unite all the corrupt interests of the nation to his
party. But neither the sense of their duty, nor the care of their
own safety, nor the just apprehensions of being overcome by their
irreconcilable enemy, could prevail with the army to return to
their proper station. So that having tasted of sovereignty under
the shadow of their late master, they resolved against the restitution
of the Parliament. And in order to this it was agreed to
proclaim Richard Cromwell, eldest son of Oliver, Protector of the
Commonwealth, in hopes that he, who by following his pleasures
had rendered himself unfit for public business, would not fail to
place the administration of the government in the hands of those
who were most powerful in the army. Accordingly the proclamation
was published in Westminster, at Temple-Bar, and at the
Old Exchange, with as few expressions of joy as had ever been
observed on the like occasion. This being done, the Council
issued out orders to the officers of civil justice to act by virtue of
their old commissions till new ones could be sent to them: and
that nothing might be omitted to fortify the new government,
various means were used to procure addresses from all parts,
which were brought in great numbers from the several counties
in England, Scotland, and Ireland, as also from divers regiments
of the army. One of the first acts of the new government was, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
order the funeral of the late usurper; and the Council having
resolved that it should be very magnificent, the care of it was referred
to a committee of them, who sending for Mr. Kinnersley,
master of the wardrobe, desired him to find out some precedent,
by which they might govern themselves in this important affair.
After examination of his books and papers, Mr. Kinnersley, who
was suspected to be inclined to popery, recommended to them the
solemnities used upon the like occasion for Philip the Second,
king of Spain, who had been represented to be in purgatory for
about two months. In the like manner was the body of this great
reformer laid in Somerset House: the apartment was hung with
black, the daylight was excluded, and no other but that of wax
tapers to be seen. This scene of purgatory continued till the
first of November, which being the day preceding that commonly
called All Souls, he was removed into the great hall of the said
house, and represented in effigy, standing on a bed of crimson
velvet covered with a gown of the like coloured velvet, a sceptre
in his hand, and a crown on his head. That part of the hall
wherein the bed stood was railed in, and the rails and ground
within them covered with crimson velvet. Four or five hundred
candles set in flat shining candlesticks were so placed round near
the roof of the hall, that the light they gave seemed like the rays
of the sun: by all which he was represented to be now in a state
of glory. This folly and profusion so far provoked the people,
that they threw dirt in the night on his escutcheon that was placed
over the great gate of Somerset House. I purposely omit the
rest of the pageantry, the great number of persons that attended
on the body, the procession to Westminster, the vast expense in
mourning, the state and magnificence of the monument erected
for him, with many other things that I care not to remember.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>William Lilly, the astrologer (1602-1682), to be discussed
more fully among the writers of personal memoirs,
claims a few words here as the author of an account of
Charles I. whose justice and liveliness would have met
more general recognition, but for the author&#8217;s character
as a fortune-teller, and if it had not been mingled
with the apparently serious exposition of idle prophecies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
respecting the White King. So long as he keeps clear of
the occult, Lilly is a shrewd and discriminating, as well as
a highly entertaining writer. His enumeration of individual
traits in Charles&#8217;s character is correct and instructive,
and free from any misleading bias. He was in fact
a time-server, whose main purpose was to stand well with
the powers that were, and whose sketch of Charles would
have worn another aspect if he had written after the
Restoration; but this frame of mind, at all events,
exempts him from political passion, nor does his complacency
carry him to the length of misrepresentation,
much less calumny. He is destitute of the literary power
which would have enabled him to fuse single traits into
an harmonious character; but he has supplied others with
very valuable material towards such an undertaking. One
merit the book certainly possesses in an eminent measure,
it is one of the most readable in the language. The following
passage indicates the author&#8217;s real insight into
Charles&#8217;s attractive, but infirm character; and, adversary
as he is, his remarkable agreement with Clarendon, of
whose work he had no knowledge:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;He had much of self-ends in all that he did, and a most difficult
thing it was to hold him close to his own promise or word:
he was apt to recede, unless something therein appeared compliable,
either unto his own will, profit, or judgment; so that
some foreign princes bestowed on him the character of a most
false prince, and one that never kept his word, unless for his own
advantage. Had his judgment been as sound, as his conception
was quick and nimble, he had been a most accomplished
gentleman: and though in most dangerous results, and extraordinary
serious consultations, and very material, either for state or
commonwealth, he would himself give the most solid advice, and
sound reasons, why such or such a thing should be so, or not so;
yet was he most easily withdrawn from his own most wholesome
and sound advice or resolutions; and with as much facility drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
on, inclined, to embrace a far more unsafe, and nothing so wholesome
a counsel. He would argue logically, and frame his arguments
artificially; yet never almost had the happiness to conclude
or drive on a design in his own sense, but was ever baffled with
meaner capacities. He feared nothing in this world, or disdained
any thing more than the convention of a Parliament; the very
name was a bugbear unto him. He was ever refractory against
the summoning of a Parliament, and as willingly would embrace
an opportunity to break it off. This his averseness being well
known to some grave members, they contrived at last by wit, and
the necessity of the times, that his hands were fast tied up
in granting a triennial sitting, or a perpetuity as it were unto this
present Parliament, a thing he often blamed himself for subscribing
unto, and as often those who importuned him thereunto.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Bulstrode Whitelocke (1605-1676) has few pretensions
to rank as a man of letters; but his <i>Memorials</i> are far too
valuable a source of historical information to be omitted
from a survey of the literature of the period. The author,
a barrister and a Templar, was elected to the Long Parliament
in 1641, and appointed chairman of the committee
for drawing up the charges against Strafford. He held
various offices under the Parliament, and was employed in
negotiations with Charles, of whose execution he disapproved.
He was subsequently a member of the Council of
State, and one of the commissioners of the Great Seal. In
1653 he was sent on an embassy to Sweden, which he has
described in a valuable work. During the confused period
between the death of Cromwell and the Restoration he
was successively a commissioner of the Great Seal and a
member of the Council of State. He had some difficulty
in obtaining pardon at the Restoration; but ultimately
Charles II. admitted him to his presence, and received
him graciously, with a speech which Whitelocke&#8217;s biographer
thinks extraordinary, but which appears very sensible:
&#8216;Mr. Whitelocke, go into the country; don&#8217;t trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
yourself any more about state affairs; and take care of
your wife and your sixteen children.&#8217; Whitelocke profited
by the royal admonition, and died at a good old age. His
<i>Memorials</i> extend from 1625 to 1659, and are a valuable
body of material, being for most of the time a diurnal
record of all occurrences of importance. They are the
student of history&#8217;s indispensable companion for the period,
but aim at no more exalted position in literature than that
of a matter-of-fact register.</p>

<p>Another diarist of a similar description to Whitelocke,
but not, like him, a busy actor in the scenes which he
describes, is Narcissus Luttrell (1657-1732), a scion of the
well-known family of Luttrell of Dunster, Somersetshire.
Luttrell, who was a man of literary and antiquarian tastes,
and the collector of the Luttrell Ballads, now in the
British Museum, kept a diary from 1675 to 1714, which
attracted little attention until Macaulay&#8217;s frequent references
to the MS. induced the University of Oxford to
publish it in 1857.</p>

<p>Leaving diarists out of account, the most important
writer of historical memoirs after Ludlow is Sir William
Temple (1628-1699), whose memoirs treat of his own
political career from 1672 to 1680. Temple, the son of an
Irish judge, entered the diplomatic service after the Restoration
under the auspices of Arlington, and soon found
himself minister at Brussels. While occupying that post
it was his good fortune to perform one of the most creditable
diplomatic achievements on record, the negotiation
of the triple alliance between England, Holland, and
Sweden, which checked the conquests of Louis XIV., and,
but for the venality and faithlessness of Charles II., would
have long secured peace to Europe. When Temple&#8217;s work
was undone he retired into private life, but the failure of
Charles&#8217;s disgraceful policy brought him again into diplo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>macy,
and his memoirs down to 1679 are occupied with
foreign affairs. In 1677 he had rendered his country one
of the greatest services that any man ever did, by bringing
about, in conjunction with Danby, the marriage of William
of Orange with the Princess Mary; and in 1679 he found
himself, to his discomfort and dismay&mdash;for if wise as a
serpent he was timid as a dove&mdash;charged with the mission
of reconciling king and people, who, from the discovery of
Charles&#8217;s baseness in accepting a pension from France,
seemed on the verge of entire estrangement. Temple
attempted to attain this end by the creation of a council
of thirty advisers, as a perpetual check upon the king&#8217;s
actions. The scheme might have succeeded if thirty
disinterested politicians had been forthcoming; but the
entire kingdom could barely have furnished the number
requisite for the redemption of Sodom. Temple&#8217;s memoirs
give a lively picture of the mortifications he underwent as
he gradually dwindled into a cipher; but the modern
reader will prefer to study the story in Macaulay&#8217;s famous
essay, which, if exaggerated in his expression of scorn for
Temple&#8217;s irresolution, is not unfair as a statement of fact.
At length he escaped to his books and gardens, and spent
the rest of his life in the enjoyment of a character for consummate
statesmanship, which he took care never to bring
to the test. Wisdom and virtue he certainly did possess,
but both with him were too much of the self-regarding order.
His claims to rank as a restorer of English prose are better
founded, though these, too, have been exaggerated. Johnson&#8217;s
assertion that Temple was the first writer who attended
to cadence in English prose merely evinces how
completely the power of appreciating the grand harmonies
of the Elizabethan period had died out in the eighteenth
century. He must, notwithstanding, be allowed an
honourable place among those who have rendered English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
prose lucid, symmetrical, and adapted for business; and
Macaulay has justly pointed out that the apparent length
of his sentences is mainly a matter of punctuation. The
elegance of the writer, and the egotistic caution of the
man, are excellently represented by the concluding passage
of his <i>Memoirs</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Upon the survey of all these circumstances, conjunctions,
and dispositions, both at home and abroad, I concluded in cold
blood, that I could be of no further use or service to the king
my master, and my country, whose true interests I always
thought were the same, and would be both in danger when they
came to be divided, and for that reason had ever endeavoured
the uniting them; and had compassed it, if the passions of some
few men had not lain fatally in the way, so as to raise difficulties
that I saw plainly were never to be surmounted. Therefore,
upon the whole, I took that firm resolution, in the end of the
year 1680, and the interval between the Westminster and Oxford
parliaments, never to charge myself more with any public employments;
but retiring wholly to a private life, in that posture
take my fortune with my country, whatever it should prove:
which as no man can judge, in the variety of accidents that
attend human affairs, and the chances of every day, to which
the greatest lives as well as actions are subject; so I shall not
trouble myself so much as to conjecture: <i>fata viam inveniant</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;Besides all these public circumstances, I considered myself
in my own humour, temper, and dispositions, which a man may
disguise to others, though very hardly, but cannot to himself. I
had learned by living long in courts and public affairs, that I was
fit to live no longer in either. I found the arts of a court were
contrary to the frankness and openness of my nature; and the
constraints of public business too great for the liberty of my
humour and my life. The common and proper ends of both are
the advancement of men&#8217;s fortunes; and that I never minded,
having as much as I needed, and, which is more, as I desired.
The talent of gaining riches I ever despised, as observing it to
belong to the most despisable men in other kinds: and I had
the occasions of it so often in my way, if I would have made use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of them, that I grew to disdain them, as a man does meat that
he has always before him. Therefore, I never could go to
service for nothing but wages, nor endure to be fettered in
business when I thought it was to no purpose. I knew very
well the arts of a court are, to talk the present language, to
serve the present turn, and to follow the present humour of the
prince, whatever it is: of all these I found myself so incapable,
that I could not talk a language I did not mean, nor serve a turn
I did not like, nor follow any man&#8217;s humour wholly against my
own. Besides, I have had, in twenty years experience, enough
of the uncertainty of princes, the caprices of fortune, the corruption
of ministers, the violence of factions, the unsteadiness
of counsels, the infidelity of friends; nor do I think the rest of
my life enough to make any new experiments.</p>

<p>&#8216;For the ease of my own life, if I know myself, it will be
infinitely more in the retired, than it has been in the busy scene:
for no good man can, with any satisfaction, take part in the
divisions of his country, that knows and considers, as I do, what
they have cost Athens, Rome, Constantinople, Florence, Germany,
France and England: nor can the wisest man foresee how
ours will end, or what they are like to cost the rest of Christendom
as well as ourselves. I never had but two aims in public
affairs; one, to see the king great as he may be by the hearts of
his people, without which I know not how he can be great by
the constitutions of this kingdom: the other, in case our factions
must last, yet to see a revenue established for the constant
maintaining a fleet of fifty men of war, at sea or in harbour, and
the seamen in constant pay; which would be at least our safety
from abroad, and make the crown still considered in any foreign
alliances, whether the king and his parliaments should agree or
not in undertaking any great or national war. And such an
establishment I was in hopes the last parliament at Westminster
might have agreed in with the king, by adding so much of a new
fund to three hundred thousand pounds a year out of the present
customs. But these have both failed, and I am content to have
failed with them.</p>

<p>&#8216;And so I take leave of all those airy visions which have so
long busied my head about mending the world; and at the same
time, of all those shining toys or follies that employ the thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of busy men: and shall turn mine wholly to mend myself; and,
as far as consists with a private condition, still pursuing that old
and excellent counsel of Pythagoras, that we are, with all the
cares and endeavours of our lives, to avoid diseases in the body,
perturbations in the mind, luxury in diet, factions in the house,
and seditions in the state.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<span class="smaller">AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND BIOGRAPHY.</span></h2>

<p>Two private diarists, whose autobiographic records remained
unknown to their contemporaries, have justly
obtained classic rank by the publication of their records
in the nineteenth century. One of these, Samuel
Pepys, stands incontestably at the head of the world&#8217;s
literature in his own department. John Evelyn, possessing
neither the humour, the <i>navet</i>, the shrewdness, or
the uncompromising frankness of his rival and friend,
occupies a much lower place as an autobiographer, though
more highly endowed as a scholar and a man of letters.
Born in 1620 of a prosperous county family, whose fortune
had been made by the manufacture of gunpowder, he found
himself an idle young Templar at the outbreak of the Civil
War. Three days&#8217; service in the royal army sufficed him,
and in 1643 he obtained the king&#8217;s permission to travel.
This does not seem very heroic conduct, but the family
estate, lying at Wotton, near Dorking, was probably in the
actual occupation of the Parliamentarians. He remained
abroad until 1647, and his notes on art and antiquity are
among the most valuable portions of his diary. Study
and gardening were his chief occupations under the
Commonwealth, varied with some cautious intriguing on
behalf of the exiled king. Under the Restoration he was
in great favour, and, although taking no part in politics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
filled several honourable public offices. A sincere Churchman,
he was greatly alarmed by James II.&#8217;s illegalities,
and acquiesced in the Revolution as a necessary evil. In
1695 he was appointed treasurer to Greenwich Hospital.
He died in 1706. The general view of his character is
that expressed by Mr. Leslie Stephen, who describes him
as &#8216;the typical instance of the accomplished and public-spirited
gentleman of the Restoration.&#8217; The chief dissentient
from this favourable estimate is a person of weight,
De Quincey, who, in a conversation with Woodhouse,
violently attacks Evelyn&#8217;s <i>Diary</i>, three years after its publication,
as &#8216;a weak, good-for-nothing little book, much
praised by weak people,&#8217; and abuses the author as &#8216;a
shallow, empty, cowardly, vain, assuming coxcomb,&#8217; &#8216;a
mere literary fribble, a fop, and a smatterer affecting
natural history and polite learning.&#8217; There is just this
much of truth in this splenetic onslaught, that Evelyn
was an amateur in authorship, and that his high character
and influential friendships no doubt contributed much to
the esteem with which the works published in his lifetime
were regarded in his day. The <i>Diary</i> stands on a different
footing; it appealed to a remote and impartial public, and
the appeal has been justified by edition after edition.</p>

<p>Evelyn&#8217;s claims to literary distinction rest principally
upon his <i>Diary</i> and his <i>Sylva</i>, which will be noticed in
another place. The chief literary merits of the <i>Diary</i> are
its unassuming simplicity and perfect perspicuity of style
and phrase. Infinitely less interesting than Pepys&#8217;s, it
has the advantage of covering a much more extensive
period, and faithfully reflecting the feelings of a loyal,
pious, sensible Englishman at various important crises of
public affairs. Unlike Pepys, whose estimates of men and
things are very fluctuating, Evelyn is consistent, and we
may feel sure that any modification of sentiment that may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
be observed in him faithfully represents the inevitable influence
of circumstances upon a man of independent judgment.
His personal loyalty to the house of Stuart is
manifestly cooled, though not chilled, by the scandals of
Charles II.&#8217;s reign; but it is not until Church and King
come into open conflict in the reign of James II. that
Evelyn gives any countenance to a violent change of
government, which it is clear he would most willingly
have avoided. The extreme caution and moderation of his
language lend weight to his disapprobation, and indicate
more forcibly than any vigour of declamation how completely
James had alienated his true friends. Evelyn&#8217;s
position was that of one who could neither lift a hand
against the Government or stretch one out to defend it.
His unaffected style almost rises into poetry as he succinctly
enumerates the omens which heralded the downfall
of James:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;<i>October 14.</i> The King&#8217;s birthday. No guns from the Tower
as usual. The sun eclipsed at its rising. This day signal for
the victory of William the Conqueror against Harold, near
Battel, in Sussex. The wind, which had been hitherto west,
was east all this day. Wonderful expectation of the Dutch
fleet. Public prayers ordered to be read in the churches against
invasion.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>The interest of the early part of the <i>Diary</i> is of a
different kind. It is occupied with the author&#8217;s continental
travels, and shows what was thought best worth
seeing in that age, with many curious incidental traits of
manners, and examples of the hardships and perils with
which wayfarers were then beset. As always, we have to
lament that the traveller was in that day so much of a
mere sightseer, and took so little pains to acquaint himself
with the moral, intellectual, or industrial life of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
nations he visited. This was the universal failing of the
age, and of all preceding ages; not until the eighteenth
century do we meet with a really philosophical traveller.
Evelyn, however, is not insensible to humanity when it is
thrust upon his attention; and his study of painting in
his youth, and the taste for arboriculture which produced
his <i>Sylva</i>, qualify him beyond most of his contemporaries
for the description of the aspects of nature. The feeling
for nature and the feeling for humanity are well combined
in the following passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;We went then to visit the galleys, being about twenty-five in
number; the Capitaine of the Galley Royal gave us most
courteous entertainment in his cabin, the slaves in the interim
playing both loud and soft music very rarely. Then he showed
how he commanded their motions with a nod, and his whistle
making them row out. The spectacle was to me new and
strange, to see so many hundreds of miserably naked persons,
their heads being shaven close and having only high red bonnets,
a pair of coarse canvass drawers, their whole backs and legs
naked, doubly chained about their middle and legs, in couples,
and made fast to their seats, and all commanded in a trice by an
imperious and cruel seaman. One Turk amongst the rest he
much favoured, who waited on him in his cabin, but with no
other dress than the rest, and a chain locked about his leg, but
not coupled. This galley was richly carved and gilded, and most
of the rest were very beautiful. After bestowing something on
the slaves, the capitaine sent a band of them to give us music at
dinner where we lodged. I was amazed to contemplate how
these miserable caitiffs lie in their galley crowded together; yet
there was hardly one but had some occupation, by which, as
leisure and calms permitted, they got some little money, insomuch
as some of them have, after many years cruel servitude,
been able to purchase their liberty. The rising-forward and
falling-back at their oar, is a miserable spectacle, and the noise
of their chains, with the roaring of the beaten waters, has something
of strange and fearful in it to one unaccustomed to it.
They are ruled and chastised by strokes on their backs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
soles of their feet, on the least disorder, and without the least
humanity, yet are they cheerful and full of knavery.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Evelyn&#8217;s <i>Diary</i>, however, with all its desert, sinks into
insignificance beside the <i>Diary</i> of Samuel Pepys, but the
same remark applies to almost every diary in the world.
Pepys&#8217;s <i>Diary</i> has been frequently compared with Boswell&#8217;s
<i>Life of Johnson</i>, and with justice in so far as the charm of
each arises from the inimitable <i>navet</i> of the author&#8217;s self-revelations.
Boswell had a much greater character than
his own to draw, but Pepys had to be his own Johnson. It
is giving him no excessive praise to say that he makes
himself as interesting as Johnson and Boswell together.
There cannot be a stronger proof of the infinite interest and
importance of humanity that when we for once get a fellow-creature
to depict himself as he really is, the most trivial
details become matters of serious concern. We sympathize
with Pepys as we sympathize with Ulysses, and are
for the time much more anxious about the liquidation of
his tailor&#8217;s bill, or the adjustment of his misunderstandings
with his wife, than &#8216;what the Swede intends or what the
French.&#8217; The only drawback is that the Pepys in whom
we are so deeply interested is, after all, not altogether the
true Pepys; not the distinguished civil servant or the
intelligent promoter of science; not the man as he appeared
to his friends and contemporaries, but an incarnation of
whatever was petty, or ludicrous, or self-seeking in a man
of no inconsiderable official and intellectual distinction.
&#8216;A very worthy, industrious, and curious person,&#8217; says
Evelyn, &#8216;universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned
in many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of
learned men, of whom he had the conversation.&#8217; All these
traits are abundantly confirmed by passages in the <i>Diary</i>,
and yet, so infinitely more vivid is the delineation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
writer&#8217;s foibles, that one attempting to draw his character
from the <i>Diary</i> would hardly have noticed them.</p>

<p>Pepys&#8217;s life is chiefly remarkable for the extraordinary
good fortune which raised him from an humble and precarious
position to one in which he was enabled to render
great service to his country. The son of a London tailor,
whose family came from Brampton in Huntingdonshire, he
had the good fortune to be distantly related to Sir Edward
Montagu, afterwards Earl of Sandwich, one of the chief
agents in the Restoration, to whose patronage he owed
everything. A sizar and scholar at Cambridge, he married
somewhat early and imprudently, accompanied his patron
when he went as admiral to the Sound in 1658, and upon
his return appears to have filled an inferior clerkship in the
Exchequer. The Restoration brought him into the Admiralty,
and for long after his history is one of rapid rise
and increasing wealth, mainly acquired by means which
would now be thought most reprehensible in a civil servant,
but which the lax official morality of his day absolved or
but faintly condemned. In 1669 the weakness of his eyes
compelled him to discontinue his <i>Diary</i> and to solicit leave
of absence from official duty on a tour in France and Holland.
Shortly after his return he lost his wife, whose leaning to
the Roman Catholic religion gave colour to a charge
against himself of being a concealed Romanist, the object
of which was to invalidate his election to Parliament for
Aldborough. These proceedings failed, but in 1679 he was
imprisoned for a short time on an accusation of being concerned
in the Popish Plot, and, notwithstanding the
absurdity of the charge, found it advisable to withdraw
for a while from the Admiralty. He was reinstated in
1684, having in the interim made a voyage to Tangier on
public business. Under James II., who understood naval
affairs and knew the worth of Pepys, he attained to great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
influence, and the navy to this day is deeply indebted
to him for the improvements he introduced into its administration.
He lost his employments at the Revolution,
and retired to a life of scholarly leisure, dying in 1703.
In 1684 he had become President of the Royal Society, of
which he had been one of the earliest members, and long
after his retirement the members continued to meet at his
house.</p>

<p>Pepys bequeathed his library to Magdalen College, Cambridge,
where it is preserved in exactly the same condition
as he left it. The immortal <i>Diary</i> was among the books,
but attracted no notice until about 1811. It was shortly
afterwards deciphered by the Rev. J. Smith, and published
in 1825 by Lord Braybrooke, who omitted much of the
most racy and characteristic part as below the dignity
of history. These omissions were principally supplied in
the edition of the Rev. Mynors Bright, 1875; and Mr.
Henry Wheatley is now publishing an edition absolutely
complete, with the exception of some few passages positively
unprintable.</p>

<p>No work of the kind in the world&#8217;s literature can for a
moment be compared to Pepys&#8217;s <i>Diary</i>; but many circumstances
must combine ere the existence of such a book is
possible. It is characteristic of Pepys to be at once a very
extraordinary and a very ordinary person. In one point of
view he is the most perfect representative imaginable of the
bourgeois type of humanity, worthy, sensible, indispensable,
and at the same time dull, prosaic, and narrow-minded.
Yet this solid citizen has a dash of the Gil Blas in him too;
and his little rogueries and servilities appear the more
amusing by contrast with the really estimable and respectable
background of his character. These qualities combined
make a perfect hero of autobiography; his ordinary
qualities awaken a fellow-feeling for so characteristic a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
specimen of average humanity, and his deviations from the
straight path communicate the piquancy of comedy, sometimes
the exuberance of farce. Extraordinary he is too, for
assuredly no one ever recorded his thoughts and actions
with such absolute sincerity; or if anyone ever did,
his thoughts and actions were not worthy of record.
Those of Pepys, somehow, always seem worthy of being
perpetuated. However trivial they may sometimes be, they
are saved by the writer&#8217;s admirable manner, and the contagious
earnestness of his conviction that they are in truth
of deep concern. The reader, moreover, is continually
exercised by the problem whether his author is really
aware of the display he is making of himself. If he is, he
is a miracle of courage; if not, his obtuseness is equally
extraordinary. The <i>Diary</i>, besides, is no less admirable as
a delineation of the macrocosm than of the microcosm. It
paints the official and private circles in which the author
moved, the course of public affairs, the humours of social
life, with no less truth and frankness than it reveals the
author himself. It is by far the most valuable document
extant for the understanding of the times; better than
all the histories and all the comedies. It seems an unequalled
piece of irony that the supreme piece of workmanship
in its way and the most lucid mirror of its age
should be the performance of an ordinary citizen who
had not the least idea that he was doing anything remarkable;
who expected celebrity, if he expected it at all,
from his official tasks and scientific recreations; who
shrouded his work in shorthand lest the world should
profit by it; and who would have been dismayed beyond
measure if he had foreseen that it would be published
after his death. Many chances have conspired for its preservation;
it is wonderful that the writer should not have
destroyed it; beyond expectation that he should have be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>queathed
it to Magdalen College; fortunate, to say the least,
that it should have been so well preserved there, and have
attracted attention at last. We shall never be able to determine
whether we have more reason to be thankful that
it was carried on so long, and so fortunately preserved, or
to lament that it was not continued throughout the periods
of the Popish Plot and the Rye House Plot, of Monmouth&#8217;s
rising, and of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The <i>Diary</i> extends from January 1st, 1660, to May 31st,
1669, when Pepys writes, &#8216;And thus ends all that I doubt I
shall ever be able to do with my own eyes in the keeping of
my journal.&#8217; He recovered his sight, at least to a great extent,
but the habit was broken, and never resumed. He had in the
interim seen and described the Restoration, the Great Plague,
the Great Fire, and the great disaster of 1667, when the
Dutch burned the English fleet in the Medway. During this
time he had seen continually and been on terms more
or less intimate with Charles II., the Duke of York, Monk,
Clarendon, Sandwich, Shaftesbury, Sir William Coventry,
and a multitude of persons of lower degree of almost every
class of society except the Puritans, who are only represented
by his worthy predecessor in office, Mr. Blackburne.
He has displayed himself to us in almost every possible
attitude, attending to accounts, drafting state papers,
measuring the timber in the dockyards, giving and taking
bribes, defending himself before the House of Commons,
alternately a Mercury and a Mentor to his patron, dissipating
at the theatre, flirting and something more with
actresses and pretty servants, helping to set the Royal
Society going, sitting for his portrait, practising music,
buying and binding books, a perfect Proteus, yet always
the same Pepys, a true type of his age in its peculiar idiosyncrasies,
and of human nature in its essential sameness,
heroic in no respect, yet admirable in many, and, with many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
meannesses, by no means despicable, as good an example as
can be found of the truth of Goethe&#8217;s dictum:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Ein guter Mensch in seinem dunkeln Drange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ist sich des rechten Weges wohl bewusst.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is impossible to pass over so unique a work as the
<i>Diary</i> without extract, yet extracts can only convey the
impression of bricks from a building. The following have
been selected chiefly with reference to their incomparable
quaintness and raciness, the one grace which our literature
has forfeited without hope of recovery.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;<i>July 18, 1660.</i> Thence to my Lord about business, and being
in talk in comes one with half a buck from Hinchinbroke, and it
smelling a little strong my Lord did give it to me. I did carry
it to my mother.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>July 8, 1661.</i> But, above all, our trouble is to find that his
estate appears nothing as we expected, and as all the world
believes; nor his papers so well sorted as I would have had
them, but all in confusion, that break my brains to understand
them. We missed also the surrenders of his copyhold land,
without which the land would not come to us, but to the heir-at-law,
so that what with this, and the badness of the drink, and the
ill opinion I have of the meat, and the biting of the gnats by
night, and my disappointment in getting home this week, and the
trouble of sorting all the papers, I am almost out of my wits with
trouble, only I appear the more contented, because I would not
have my father troubled.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Feb. 19, 1665.</i> In the evening comes Mr. Andrews, and we
sung together, and at supper hearing by accident of my maids
their letting in a roguing Scotch woman that haunts the office, to
help them to wash and scour in our house, and that very lately,
I fell mightily out, and made my wife, to the disturbance of the
house and neighbours, to beat our little girl, and then we shut
her down into the cellars, and there she lay all night.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>July 12, 1667.</i> Thence after dinner home, and there find my
wife in a dogged humour for my not dining at home, and I did
give her a pull by the nose and some ill words, which she pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>voked
me to by something she spoke, that we fell extraordinarily
out, insomuch that, I going to the office to avoid further anger,
she followed me in a devilish manner thither, and with much ado
I got her into the garden out of hearing, to prevent shame, and so
home, and by degrees I find it necessary to calm her, and did,
and then to the office, where pretty late, and then to walk with
her in the garden, and pretty good friends, and so to bed with my
mind quiet.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Aug. 18, 1667.</i> I walked towards White Hall, but, being
weary, turned into St. Dunstan&#8217;s Church, where I heard an able
sermon of the minister of the place; and stood by a pretty,
modest maid, whom I did labour to take by the hand; but she
would not, but got further and further from me; and at last I
could perceive her to take pins out of her pocket to prick me if I
should touch her again; which seeing I did forbear, and was glad
I did spy her design. And then I fell to gaze upon another
pretty maid in a pew close to me, and she on me; and I did go
about to take her by the hand, which she suffered a little and then
withdrew. So the sermon ended, and the church broke up, and
my amours also.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Oct. 4, 1667.</i> To see Sir W. Batten. He is asleep, and so I
could not see him; but in an hour after word is brought me that
he is so ill that it is believed he cannot live till to-morrow, which
troubles me and my wife mightily, partly out of kindness, he
being a good neighbour, and partly out of the money he owes
me, upon our bargain of the late prize.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>navet</i> of these passages, and of hundreds more
like them, remains unequalled in literature. Novelists,
as Le Sage in <i>Gil Blas</i> and Thackeray in <i>Barry Lyndon</i>,
have striven hard to make their personages paint themselves
as they really are, but their art is far excelled by
Pepys&#8217;s nature. If, as Carlyle deems, speech and hearing
were principally bestowed upon us that &#8216;our brother might
impart to us truly how it stands with him in that inner
man of his,&#8217; no man has turned the former of these gifts to
better account than Pepys. The same sincerity renders
him a truthful mirror of public sentiment; and his very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
limitations, intellectual and moral, enhance the value of
his testimony. He has no bias to interfere with the veracity
of his delineation; he simply reports what people around
him are saying and thinking; he can show us how the
stream goes, because he is borne along with it himself.
The lively description which we are about to quote of the
consternation caused by the Dutch irruption into the
Thames in 1667, is an admirable example of his power of
reproducing the atmosphere around him:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;June 13th. No sooner up but hear the sad news confirmed of
the Royal Charles being taken by them, and now in fitting by them,
which Pett should have carried up higher by our several orders,
and deserves, therefore, to be hanged for not doing it, and burning
several others; and that another fleet is come up into the Hope.
Upon which news the King and Duke of York have been below
since four o&#8217;clock in the morning, to command the sinking of
ships at Barking-Creek, and other places, to stop their coming
up higher: which put me into such a fear, that I presently
resolved of my father&#8217;s and wife&#8217;s going into the country; and,
at two hours&#8217; warning, they did go by the coach this day, with
about 1,300 in gold in their night-bag. Pray God give them
good passage, and good care to hide it when they come home!
but my heart is full of fear. They gone, I continued in fright
and fear what to do with the rest. W. Hewer hath been at the
banker&#8217;s, and hath got 500 out of Backewell&#8217;s hands of his own
money; but they are so called upon that they will be all broke,
hundreds coming to them for money: and they answer him, &#8220;It
is payable at twenty days&mdash;when the days are out, we will pay
you;&#8221; and those that are not so, they make tell over their
money, and make their bags false, on purpose to give cause to
retell it, and so spend time. I cannot have my 200 pieces of
gold again for silver, all being bought up last night that were to
be had, and sold for 24 and 25/ a-piece. So I must keep the
silver by me, which sometimes I think to fling into the house of
office, and then again know not how I shall come by it, if we be
made to leave the office. Every minute some one or other calls
for this or that order; and so I forced to be at the office most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of the day about the fire-ships which are to be suddenly fitted
out; and it&#8217;s a most strange thing that we hear nothing from
any of my brethren at Chatham: so that we are wholly in the
dark, various being the reports of what is done there; insomuch
that I sent Mr. Clapham express thither to see how matters go.
I did, about noon, resolve to send Mr. Gibson away after my wife
with another 1,000 pieces, under colour of an express to Sir
Jeremy Smith; who is, as I hear, with some ships at Newcastle;
which I did really send to him, and may, possibly, prove of good
use to the King; for it is possible, in the hurry of business, they
may not think of it at Court, and the charge of an express is not
considerable to the King. The King and Duke of York up and
down all the day here and there; sometime on Tower Hill, where
the City militia was; where the King did make a speech to them,
that they should venture themselves no further than he would
himself. I also sent, my mind being in pain, Saunders after my
wife and father, to overtake them at their night&#8217;s lodging, to see
how matters go with them. In the evening, I sent for my cousin
Sarah and her husband, who come; and I did deliver them my
chest of writings about Brampton, and my brother Tom&#8217;s papers,
and my journals, which I value much; and did send my two
silver flagons to Kate Joyce&#8217;s: that so, being scattered what I
have, something might be saved. I have also made a girdle, by
which, with some trouble, I do carry about me 300 in gold
about my body, that I may not be without something in case I
should be surprised: for I think, in any nation but our&#8217;s, people
that appear, for we are not indeed so, so faulty as we, would
have their throats cut.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;July 14th (Lord&#8217;s day). Up, and my wife, a little before four,
and to make us ready; and by and by Mrs. Turner come to us,
by agreement, and she and I staid talking below, while my wife
dressed herself, which vexed me that she was so long about it,
keeping us till past five o&#8217;clock before she was ready. She
ready; and, taking some bottles of wine, and beer, and some
cold fowl with us into the coach, we took coach and four horses,
which I had provided last night, and so away. A very fine day,
and so towards Epsom, talking all the way pleasantly, and particularly
of the pride and ignorance of Mrs. Lowther, in having
of her train carried up. The country very fine, only the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
very dusty. To Epsom, by eight o&#8217;clock, to the well; where
much company, and I drank the water: they did not, but I did
drink four pints. And to the town, to the King&#8217;s Head; and
hear that my Lord Buckhurst and Nelly are lodged at the next
house, and Sir Charles Sedley with them: and keep a merry
house. Poor girl! I pity her; but more the loss of her at the
King&#8217;s house. W. Hewer rode with us, and I left him and the
women, and myself walked to church, where few people to what
I expected, and none I knew, but all the Houblons, brothers, and
them after sermon I did salute, and walk with towards my
inn.... Then I carried them to see my cousin Pepys&#8217;s house,
and &#8216;light, and walked round about it, and they like it, as
indeed it deserves, very well, and is a pretty place; and then
I walked them to the wood hard by, and there got them in
the thickets till they had lost themselves, and I could not find
the way into any of the walks in the wood, which indeed are
very pleasant, if I could have found them. At last got out of
the wood again; and I, by leaping down the little bank, coming
out of the wood, did sprain my right foot, which brought me
great present pain, but presently, with walking, it went away for
the present, and so the women and W. Hewer and I walked
upon the Downs, where a flock of sheep was; and the most
pleasant and innocent sight that ever I saw in my life. We
found a shepherd and his little boy reading, far from any houses
or sight of people, the Bible to him; so I made the boy read to
me, which he did, with the forced tone that children do usually
read, that was mighty pretty, and then I did give him something,
and went to the father, and talked with him; and I find
he had been a servant in my cousin Pepys&#8217;s house, and told me
what was become of their old servants. He did content himself
mightily in my liking his boy&#8217;s reading, and did bless God for
him, the most like one of the old patriarchs that ever I saw in
my life, and it brought those thoughts of the old age of the
world in my mind for two or three days after. We took notice
of his woollen knit stockings of two colours mixed, and of his
shoes shod with iron, both at the toe and heels, and with great
nails in the soles of his feet, which was mighty pretty: and,
taking notice of them, why, says the poor man, the downs, you
see, are full of stones, and we are fain to shoe ourselves thus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and these, says he, will make the stones fly till they ring before
me. I did give the poor man something, for which he was
mighty thankful, and I tried to cast stones with his horn crook.
He values his dog mightily, that would turn a sheep any way
which he would have him, when he goes to fold them: told me
there was about eighteen score sheep in his flock, and that he
hath four shillings a week the year round for keeping of them:
and Mrs. Turner, in the common fields here, did gather one of
the prettiest nosegays that ever I saw in my life. So to our
coach, and through Mr. Minnes&#8217;s wood, and looked upon Mr.
Evelyn&#8217;s house; and so over the common, and through Epsom
town to our inn, in the way stopping a poor woman with her
milk-pail, and in one of my gilt tumblers did drink our bellyfuls
of milk, better than any cream; and so to our inn, and
there had a dish of cream, but it was sour, and so had no
pleasure in it; and so paid our reckoning, and took coach, it
being about seven at night, and passed and saw the people
walking with their wives and children to take the air, and we set
out for home, the sun by and by going down, and we in the cool
of the evening all the way with much pleasure home, talking and
pleasing ourselves with the pleasure of this day&#8217;s work. Mrs.
Turner mightily pleased with my resolution, which, I tell her, is
never to keep a country-house, but to keep a coach, and with my
wife on the Saturday to go sometimes for a day to this place, and
then quit to another place; and there is more variety and as
little charge, and no trouble, as there is in a country-house.
Anon it grew dark, and we had the pleasure to see several glow-worms,
which was mighty pretty, but my foot begins more and
more to pain me, which Mrs. Turner, by keeping her warm hand
upon it, did much ease; but so that when we come home, which
was just at eleven at night, I was not able to walk from the
lane&#8217;s end to my house without being helped. So to bed, and
there had a cere-cloth laid to my feet, but in great pain all night
long.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Pepys&#8217;s correspondence forms a useful adjunct to his
diary. Some of the letters addressed to him are very
entertaining, especially that from Sir Samuel Morland on
his matrimonial misadventures. His own letters are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
usually couched in a formal full-dress style, contrasting
strongly with the careless ease of the <i>Diary</i>. Numerous
letters and other documents from Pepys&#8217;s pen on Admiralty
affairs are extant in various repositories, and should be
collected and published. He is also the author of an
anonymous work on the deposition of Alphonso VI. of
Portugal, entitled <i>The Portugal History, or a Relation
of the Troubles that happened in the Court of Portugal in the
years 1667 and 1668</i> (published in 1677), which deserves
more notice than it has received. It is a curious history
of a palace revolution, which must have been written to
order by the help of official documents, and is the more
remarkable from the close family connection of the Portuguese
and English Courts, which latter must have approved,
if it did not instigate the publication.</p>

<p>Much space has here been given to Pepys, and not
unreasonably, for his will be to all ages the classical model
of the diary, and a model to which not only no one ever
will attain, but to which no one will endeavour to attain.
Such transparent candour and artless <i>navet</i> will hardly
in any future age of the world be found united to his parts
and knowledge. He is as supreme in his own sphere as
Milton in his; and another Milton is more likely to appear
than another Pepys.</p>

<p>Another diarist, who, though far inferior to Pepys,
deserves to be named along with him, is Sir John Reresby
(1634-89), a Yorkshire baronet, of Thrybergh Hall, in
the West Riding, a person of great influence by his
standing and property in the county. His objects in
writing, he informs us, were &#8216;to instruct posterity how
long it has pleased Providence to continue us Reresbys
in the same name and place; to save the labour of turning
over a great many obscure papers; and to preserve
memorials of some things of use as well as of curiosity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>&#8217;
This seems like the prelude to a family history; the really
important part of the book, however, is not the introductory
sketch of Reresby&#8217;s ancestors, but a diary with very
wide gaps devoted in the main to setting forth the writer&#8217;s
relations with the Court and his neighbours. To the
latter he is the grand seigneur; towards the former his
attitude is not unlike that of Pepys; he aims to provide
as well for himself as possible without dipping too deeply
into corruption or absolutely selling himself to promote
the designs of arbitrary power. He attaches himself to
Danby, whose leading maxim was to build upon the support
of the country gentry; successively follows him and
Halifax with some misgivings; and, though a devoted
servant of James II., his enumeration of that monarch&#8217;s
tyrannical acts is so honest, that, if every document of the
age had perished except his diary, enough might be deduced
from this to justify the Revolution. At this time he was
Governor of York, where he was surprised and imprisoned;
and death overtook him shortly afterwards hesitating between
the old king and the new. His memoirs, imperfectly
published in 1734, were edited from the original MS. by
Mr. Cartwright in 1875.</p>

<p>Rich as the age was in the diaries of private men and
memoirs of public transactions, it did not produce many
narratives of private lives in strictly autobiographic form.
The most important was that of William Lilly the astrologer,
whose character of Charles I. has been already
noticed. If, as most think, an astrologer must be either a
fool or a knave, there can be no doubt under which class
to range this entertaining author. Born (1601) at Diseworth
in Leicestershire, &#8216;a town of great rudeness,&#8217; he
was indebted for his grammar-school education to his
father&#8217;s decayed estate, which made the farm not worth
following, and for his transfer to London to his total un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>fitness
for all agricultural work. He walked up to London
by the side of the carrier&#8217;s waggon, got a place in London
as general servant, where &#8216;I saw and ate good white bread,
contrary to our diet in Leicestershire;&#8217; but, on the other
hand, &#8216;sometimes helped to carry eighteen tubs of water
from the Thames in one morning.&#8217; Within a few years he
made his fortune by marrying his master&#8217;s widow, and devoted
himself for the rest of his life to mathematical and
astrological pursuits. He died, in good circumstances, in
1681, and was honourably interred at the expense of Elias
Ashmole, to whom his autobiography is addressed. His
numerous astrological writings do not concern us here;
his memoirs are no less valuable than entertaining for the
glimpses they afford into bygone manners and contemporary
feeling on public affairs, and particularly for the
lively portrayal of the singular characters with whom
Lilly was professionally brought into connection, prototypes
of the spiritualistic mediums of a later day, and not
unfairly represented by William Hodges, &#8216;whose angels
were Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel; his life answered not
in holiness and sanctity to what it should, having to deal
with those holy angels.&#8217; The following description of a
Welsh conjuror is a characteristic example of Lilly&#8217;s
graphic touch:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;It happened on one Sunday 1632, as myself and a Justice of
Peace&#8217;s clerk were, before service, discoursing of many things,
he chanced to say, that such a person was a great scholar, nay,
so learned, that he could make an almanack, which to me then
was strange: One speech begot another, till, at last, he said, he
could bring me acquainted with one Evans in Gun-Powder-Alley,
who had formerly lived in Staffordshire, that was an excellent
wise man, and studied the black art. The same week after
we went to see Mr. Evans. When we come to his house, he
having been drunk the night before, was upon his bed, if it be
lawful to call that a bed whereon he then lay; he roused up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
himself, and, after some compliments, he was content to instruct
me in astrology. I attended his best opportunities for seven or
eight weeks, in which time I could set a figure perfectly: Books
he had not any, except Haly de judiciis Astrorum, and Origanus&#8217;s
Ephemerides; so that as often as I entered his house, I
thought I was in the Wilderness. Now something of the man:
He was by birth a Welshman, a Master of Arts, and in sacred
orders; he had formerly had a cure of souls in Staffordshire, but
now was come to try his fortunes at London, being in a manner
enforced to fly for some offences very scandalous committed by
him in these parts where he had lately lived; for he gave judgment
upon things lost, the only shame of astrology: He was the
most saturnine person my eyes ever beheld, either before I
practised or since; of a middle stature, broad forehead, beetle-browed,
thick shoulders, flat-nosed, full lips, down-looked, black
curling stiff hair, splay-footed; to give him his right, he had the
most piercing judgment naturally upon a figure of theft, and
many other questions, that I ever met withal; yet for money he
would willingly give contrary judgments, was much addicted to
debauchery, and then very abusive and quarrelsome, seldom
without a black eye, or one mischief or other: This is the same
Evans who made so many antimonial cups, upon the sale whereof
he principally subsisted; he understood Latin very well, the
Greek tongue not at all: He had some arts above, and beyond
astrology, for he was well versed in the nature of spirits, and had
many times used the circular way of invocating, as in the time of
our familiarity he told me.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Considering the fertility of the age in personal memoirs,
its barrenness in biography is remarkable. Apart from the
lives by Mrs. Hutchinson and Izaak Walton, to be noticed
presently, and a few brief accounts of celebrated men
prefixed to their writings, almost the only example is the
cluster of valuable and entertaining family histories for
which we are indebted to Roger North (1653-1734), and
one of these is an autobiography. Roger North, brother
of Francis, Lord Guilford, Chief Justice of the Common
Pleas and Jeffreys&#8217;s predecessor in the Great Seal, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
barrister, and a man of sound, though hardly shining
parts, who owed his extensive practice at the bar to the
influence of his relative. It fell off under the malevolent
discouragement of Jeffreys, and, at the Revolution, Roger,
unable to take the oaths to the new government, retired to
his country estate in Norfolk, where he spent a vigorous
old age in gardening, building, vindicating the memory of
his brothers, writing his own biography, and &#8216;cheerfully
communicating to all, without fee or reward, his great
knowledge of the law&#8217;&mdash;virtuous behaviour, but unprofessional.
Two of the Norths were men of unusual ability,
the Lord Keeper and Sir Dudley, the eminent Turkey
merchant, who returned from a prosperous career at
Constantinople to pack juries, as his enemies alleged,
in the storms of the Exclusion Bill agitation, and to
signalize himself as an authority on questions of trade and
finance. The Norths, a jovial race, full of sap and substance,
were staunch Cavaliers, and Roger&#8217;s biographies of
his brothers grew out of a vindication of the Lord Keeper
against the attacks of Bishop White Kennett. His apologetic
<i>Examen</i>, not published until after his death, though
important for the history of the time, can hardly rank as
literature. The biographies and autobiography, on the
other hand, are very good literature, though Dr. Jessopp
is hardly warranted in styling them English classics.
They are neither planned with classic symmetry nor
executed with classic elegance; but are charming from
their artless loquacity and the atmosphere of fraternal
affection in which they are steeped, as well as most entertaining
from their wealth of anecdote and their portraits,
partial, but not intentionally unfair, of remarkable men.
Two elements in these books are sharply contrasted, the
political and the anecdotic. The former affords a melancholy
but useful representation of the factious unreason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of political parties in that age, especially Roger&#8217;s, and of
the prejudices which kept Englishmen apart until they
learned toleration from Locke and Hoadly. It is to
Roger&#8217;s credit that, although he had done his best to put
it into James II.&#8217;s power to overthrow the Church and
trample on the laws, he recoiled when the crisis came. A
page or two after expressing his opinion that good citizens
never resist arbitrary power, he is found inconsistently,
though very rightly, lauding his brother Dudley for refusing,
under the strongest pressure from James, to mortgage
his vote in Parliament; and the whole tenor of his
memoirs shows that, although his principles would not
allow him to acquiesce openly in the Revolution, he was at
the bottom of his heart by no means sorry for it. His antipathy
to Jeffreys, who had enacted towards his brother the
part which Laud had formerly performed towards Abbot,
may have had something to do with this attitude. His
portraits of eminent lawyers, such as Hale, Saunders, and
Maynard, though sometimes disfigured by party feeling,
have signal value. The anecdotic part of the memoirs,
on the other hand, is delightful reading, being full of
good-natured fun, shrewd observation, and interesting
glimpses of the manners of the times, sometimes well
worth noting, as, for example, this testimony to the popularity
of the Church of England in Wales in Charles II.&#8217;s
time: &#8216;I remember the doctor&#8217; (Roger&#8217;s brother John,
Master of Trinity College, Cambridge) &#8216;told us that when
he came to his parish, he found the humour of the people
very different from what, on like occasions, was often
found in England. For, instead of grumbling at and
affronting a new tithe-monger came down amongst them,
too often known in English villages, the parishioners came
about him and hugged him, calling him their pastor, and
telling him they were his sheep.&#8217; There are two especial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
repositories of anecdotes in North&#8217;s volumes, that of
stories of circuits and eminent lawyers in his memoir of
the Lord Keeper and his own autobiography, and the
Turkish and Levantine sketches in the life of his brother
Dudley. The latter gives a most curious picture of the
relations of Mussulmans and Christians in the days when
this was the fashion in which unbelievers were noticed by
sultans:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;The great officers about the Grand Signor, with whom he
[Dudley North] had transacted and familiarly conversed, told his
majesty that there was now in the city of Constantinople an
extraordinary <i>gower</i> [Giaour], as well for person as abilities to
transact the greatest affairs. The Grand Signor declared that
he would see this extraordinary <i>gower</i>: and accordingly the
merchant was told of it; and at the time appointed an officer
conducted him into the seraglio, and carried him about till he
came to a little garden, and there two other men took him by
the two arms and led him to a place where he saw the Grand
Signor sitting against a large window open in a chamber not very
high from the ground; the men that were his conductors, holding
each an arm, put their hands upon his neck and bowed him down
till his forehead touched the ground; and this was done more
than once, and is the very same forced obeisance of ambassadors
at their audiences. After this he stood bolt upright as long as
the Grand Signor thought fit to look at him; and then, upon a
sign given, he was taken away and set free again by himself to
reflect on this his romantic audience.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>This &#8216;extraordinary <i>gower</i>&#8217; appears to have been the
perfect ideal of an orientalized John Bull. Having, as his
brother assures us, &#8216;an uncommon disposition to truth,&#8217; it
is surprising to find him actively concerned in the subornation
of perjury in Turkish law-courts, but this Roger considers
a demonstration of the strength of his mind:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;One must have a strong power of thought to abstract the
prejudices of our domestic education and plant ourselves in a
way of negotiating in heathen remote countries.&#8217;</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mrs. Hutchinson&#8217;s
<i>Life of Col.
Hutchinson</i>.</div>

<p>Another biography of the time unknown to the age
which produced it, but a standard work
and general favourite since its republication
early in the nineteenth century, is
the life of Colonel Hutchinson, by his
widow. Lucy Hutchinson, third daughter of Sir Allen
Apsley, Governor of the Tower, was born in 1620, and in
1638 married Colonel John Hutchinson, of a good Nottinghamshire
family, who, after having taken an active part on
the parliamentary side during the Civil War, acted as one of
the king&#8217;s judges, and retired into private life rather than
accept employment under Cromwell. He escaped prosecution
at the Restoration, but afterwards, upon suspicion of
engaging in plots, was imprisoned in Deal Castle, where
he died from the unwholesomeness of his quarters. His
widow wrote his life between 1664 and 1670, but it was
not published until 1806. It is naturally an unqualified
panegyric upon her husband, redeemed from insipidity by
the conjugal affection and devotion which inspire it, and
the elegant simplicity of the style. In panegyrizing her
husband, Mrs. Hutchinson unwittingly extols herself; she
has no doubt that he was among the wisest as well as the
best men of his time, and her simple conviction is so
touching, that the reader is almost persuaded to think
so too. One of the most high-minded he certainly was,
but his independence verged upon impracticability. The
strictly historical value of the work is small, except as
regards incidents of the Civil War in Nottinghamshire.
Mrs. Hutchinson was a highly accomplished woman, and
made a metrical translation of Lucretius, which is extant
in MS. in the British Museum. The time of her death
is not known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
Biography:
Izaak
Walton,
1593-1683.</div>

<p>The most important ecclesiastical biography by a contemporary
writer is the life of Archbishop Williams, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Bishop Hacket (1592-1670), the munificent restorer of Lichfield
Cathedral, which, although first published in 1693, was
completed in 1657, and will be more fitly noticed under the
pre-Restoration period. This, though more
intrinsically valuable, is much less known
than a series of little religious biographies
which owe their fame partly to the superior
attractiveness of the characters depicted, partly
to their more manageable compass, and partly
to the charm of a tender and pious spirit, rather than of
style. Singularly enough, the author owes a still larger
measure of fame to another book composed in a similar
spirit, but on a subject at first sight (were it not for the
profession of St. Peter) wide as the poles asunder from
ecclesiastical biography. Izaak Walton, biographer of
Donne, and author of <i>The Complete Angler</i>, was born at
Stafford in 1593, and died at Winchester in 1683. He
appears to have settled in London as a draper about 1616,
in a little shop over the Exchange, &#8216;seven feet long and five
feet wide.&#8217; In 1624 he was established in Fleet Street, near
the south-west corner of Chancery Lane. In 1643, having
secured a competency by trade, and probably finding that
his churchmanship and royalism exposed him to annoyance
in London, he gave up business and withdrew into the
country, living, Wood says, &#8216;mostly in the families of the
eminent clergymen of England,&#8217; unquiet habitations in
those times, one would imagine. He had, during his
residence in London, greatly ingratiated himself with the
dignified clergy, and distinguished himself as the biographer
of one of the most eminent among them, though
this seems to have been a mere accident, Sir Henry Wotton
having requested him to collect materials for a life of
Donne, which he intended to have written himself. Wotton
dying without having performed his purpose, his mantle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
fell upon Walton, whose memoir, prefixed to an edition of
Donne&#8217;s sermons, published in 1640, obtained so much
success that he was requested to write the life of Wotton
himself. This was completed in 1644, and appeared in
1651 along with the <i>Reliquiae Wottonianae</i>, a collection
edited by Walton. The lives of Hooker and Herbert (the
former a commission from Archbishop Sheldon) were
written shortly after the Restoration, under the roof of
Morley, Bishop of Winchester; the life of Bishop Sanderson
was written as late as 1675. Meanwhile the
<i>Complete Angler, or Contemplative Man&#8217;s Recreation</i>, the
book on which Walton&#8217;s fame after all principally rests,
had appeared in 1653, with copies of complimentary verse
prefixed which seem to prove that it was ready for the
press in 1650. One of these effusions, by Thomas Weaver,
dated 1649, is a poem of unusual merit, much in the style
of Marvell. Walton, who had married a sister of Bishop
Ken, died in the house of his son-in-law, Prebendary
Hawkins of Winchester, in 1683. His will, which he had
himself drawn up a short time previously, shows the undiminished
vigour of his faculties, and the endurance of
his connection with his native county. His character may
be read in every page of his writings, and is such as to
prove that with him angling was indeed the recreation of
a contemplative man.</p>

<p>The maxim <i>noscitur a sociis</i> is entirely in Walton&#8217;s
favour, for his ecclesiastical heroes are the flower of the
Church of England of his day. His treatment is in
general very satisfactory, entirely sympathetic, the first
qualification of biography, and much less marred by prejudice
and party spirit than was to have been expected
from the agitated character of the times. The simple unaffected
style almost verges upon garrulity. Though not a
scholar, Walton seems to have possessed sufficient acquaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>ance
with theology to avoid misrepresentation of eminent
divines; while the chief value of his work consists in its
portrayal of almost ideal charity, meekness, and learning;
and in the curious anecdotes embedded in it, such as
Pope Clement VIII.&#8217;s high appreciation of Hooker,
James I.&#8217;s influence upon the composition of Sarpi&#8217;s
<i>History of the Council of Trent</i>, Charles I.&#8217;s translation
of Sanderson (unfortunately lost), and his infatuated
regret expressed to the same divine for having consented
to the abolition of episcopacy in Scotland. Walton, into
whose composition mirth entered, but not humour, records
this with the same gravity with which he chronicles
Charles&#8217;s injunction to the Merry Monarch to be above
all things diligent in the study of Richard Hooker. Some
light may possibly be thrown upon the vexed question of
the interpolation of the last three books of the <i>Ecclesiastical
Polity</i>, by the statement of Hoole, a contemporary
schoolmaster, when exhorting his scholars to good penmanship,
that many of Hooker&#8217;s sermons had been destroyed
after his death from the impossibility of deciphering
his handwriting.</p>

<span class="smaller">DIVINITY.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The Pulpit in
the Restoration
epoch.</div>

<p>Passing from the biographers of divines to the divines
themselves, we observe that, with the signal
exception of <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>, nearly all
the writers in this department whose productions
have established a claim to rank
among English classics belong to &#8216;the company of the
preachers.&#8217; This is not in itself surprising; preaching
stimulates eloquence, and the homilist enjoys a much
greater freedom of range, and a fuller exemption from
restraint, than the writer upon strictly technical or professional
subjects. It does, however, at first sight seem remarkable,
that an age so generally decried for immorality
as the Restoration should, with the decade immediately
preceding, have been the golden age of the English pulpit.
In fact, as we have implied when treating of the drama, the
apparent licence of the age did not really extend much beyond
gay and fashionable circles, which could not greatly
affect the pulpit except to its advantage, by furnishing
it with impressive topics. Even in these circles immorality
was far from necessarily implying irreligion; and the sober
citizens who crowded churches and meeting-houses, and the
universities, whose routine afforded so many opportunities
for the delivery of discourses from the pulpit, were much
as heretofore. In the rudimentary condition of the press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
as an organ of public information and education, and when
the meeting was hardly an institution as yet, the spoken
word possessed a power of which the newspaper has since
gone far to deprive it. In times of public disquiet, such
as the days of the Exclusion Bill or those which preceded
the Revolution, churches and chapels were crowded
with people seeking guidance, popular sermons went
through edition after edition, and popular divines were
almost tribunes of the people. Theological considerations
moulded political opinion to a degree now hardly conceivable;
the storm of pamphlets on both sides called forth by
the resipiscence or tergiversation of a leading divine like
Sherlock shows what importance attached to his conduct
upon either view of it. The age, moreover, was in the
stage of literary development most favourable for pulpit
eloquence. As a huge glacier takes longer to melt than a
small one, the quaint and involved periods of the Elizabethan
pulpit stood out longer than ordinary prose against
the disintegrating influence of seventeenth century taste,
and while the new movement was triumphant in most
branches of literature, it in general only affected the style
of the sermon so far as to chasten and mellow it, leaving it
still that sonorous dignity and that flavour of the antique
with which stately and impressive eloquence can rarely dispense.
The two greatest preachers, Barrow and South,
stand just upon this culminating point of excellence,
uniting the majesty of the old style to the ease and
clearness of the new. Tillotson, going a step further, and
bringing the pulpit down to the level of ordinary educated
society, performed indeed a most useful work, but inevitably
prepared the way for the sensible but unimpressive
preaching of the next century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Isaac Barrow
(1630-1677).</div>

<p>Isaac Barrow, Master of Trinity College, was the son
of a respectable tradesman, linendraper to Charles I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
His royalist and Arminian opinions kept him back
under the Commonwealth, but after the
Restoration he was acknowledged as the
first mathematician of his country, except,
as he was the first to allow, another Isaac whose surname
was Newton. Newton, who had been Barrow&#8217;s
pupil, revised his lectures on optics (1669), an epoch-making
work, but composed in Latin, as were his scarcely
less celebrated lectures on geometry. His reputation as an
English classic rests upon two great theological works, his
<i>Treatise on the Pope&#8217;s Supremacy</i> (edited, after his death,
by Tillotson) and his <i>Exposition of the Creed</i>, and upon his
sermons, which do not seem to have been extremely popular
in his own day, though gaining the suffrage of such dissimilar
men as Locke and Charles II., who called Barrow
&#8216;an unfair preacher, because he exhausted every topic, and
left no room for anything to be said by anyone who came
after him.&#8217; It may be reasonably conjectured that when
Barrow preached before Charles he did not indulge in the
inordinate expansiveness, it was not prolixity, that sometimes
drove away his congregation. It is to the king&#8217;s
honour that his bestowal of the mastership of Trinity
upon Barrow was entirely his own act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Robert South
(1633-1716).</div>

<p>Robert South, on the whole perhaps the greatest preacher
of his age, was born in 1633, and educated
at Westminster and Christ Church. He is
accused by Antony Wood, the principal
authority for his life, of having been a time-server, who
sided successively with the Independents, the Presbyterians,
and the Church of England in the days of their power.
Wood seems, however, to have had some private grievance
against him; and if South was really at the same time so
pliant and so able, it seems strange that he should have
attained no higher preferment than stalls at Christ Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and Westminster. Quarrelsome he certainly was, and he
entered into a most acrimonious controversy with Sherlock,
which it required a royal proclamation to compose. He
died in 1716.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Tillotson
(1630-1694).</div>

<p>Unlike South&#8217;s, the character of John Tillotson is no
matter for controversy. With the possible
exception of Archbishop Herring,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he was
the most amiable man that ever filled the
see of Canterbury, and was pronounced by the discerning
and experienced William III. the best friend he had
ever had and the best man he had ever known. To
the meekness of the pastor Tillotson added the qualities of
the statesman, and happy was it for the Church of England
that such a man could be found to fill the primacy at
such a time. As a master of oratory he is greatly inferior
in eloquence to both Barrow and South, but historically is
more important than either, for Addison was influenced
by him, and his discourses long gave the tone to the English
pulpit, affording the almost universally accepted model
throughout the greater part of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Of these three great preachers South is certainly the
greatest as respects eloquence and energy of diction.
Almost every sentence is striking, and at the same time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
perfect good taste. By so much, however, as he surpasses his
rivals in purely literary qualities, does he fall below them
in others even more essential to the preacher. His judgment
is often greatly at fault, he commits himself to plainly untenable
propositions, and enforces them with the confidence
of one displaying self-evident truths. After a few experiences
of this kind the reader begins to look upon him
as a rhetorician, and to prefer the more cautious, but still
vivid and vigorous ratiocination of Barrow; or the &#8216;sweet
reasonableness&#8217; of Tillotson, inferior to Barrow, as he to
South, in the gifts of the consummate orator, but more
truly persuasive in the gentleness of his expostulation and
his transparent candour.</p>

<p>Edward Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester (1635-1699),
though a fine preacher, is less remembered in this capacity
than for his unsuccessful controversy with Locke and his
<i>Origines Sacrae</i>, a work of great learning in defence of the
Church of England, which Coleridge in his <i>Notes on Books</i>
emphatically prefers to the corresponding labours of Chillingworth.
Coleridge was naturally prejudiced in favour
of the antagonist of Locke, whose graces of mind and
person, however, are attested by a dispassionate witness,
Pepys.</p>

<p>Theology, apart from eloquence, is hardly entitled to a
place in literary history; yet some of the theologians of the
period were too illustrious to be passed over without mention.
John Pearson, Bishop of Chester (1612-1686), ranks
among the Fathers of the Church of England by his
standard work on the Creed. &#8216;Pearson&#8217;s very dust,&#8217; says
Bentley, &#8216;is gold.&#8217; Barrow&#8217;s great controversial treatise
has been mentioned. George Bull, Bishop of St. David&#8217;s
(1634-1710), achieved even more, for he extorted the
thanks of the clergy of France by his <i>Nicaenae Fidei
Defensio</i> (1685), written in Latin, but afterwards translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
into English. The author&#8217;s object was to prove the
orthodoxy of the Ante-Nicene Fathers, which had been disputed
by several Protestant divines; the cost of publication
was borne by the munificent Bishop Fell. The French
prelates further paid Bull the equivocal compliment of
wondering why in the world so excellent a man did not
join the Church of Rome. <i>Talis cum sis, utinam noster
esses.</i> Bull expounded his difficulties in a treatise on the
corruptions of that church, the most popular of his works
at home, but which, being written in English, failed to
vindicate his position in the eyes of the Frenchmen. Next
to these giants of learning may be named a very dissimilar
person, Richard Baxter (1615-1691), whom moderate men
had designated for a bishopric at the Restoration, but
whom the Bartholomew&#8217;s Day of 1662 made a Nonconformist.
He wrote one hundred and sixty-eight books,
two of which have survived, <i>A Call to the Unconverted</i> and
<i>The Saints&#8217; Everlasting Rest</i>. The latter Professor Minto
calls &#8216;a volume of pious thoughts that have a peculiar
interest when we view them as the aspirations of an infirm
man turning wearily from the distractions of a time utterly
out of joint.&#8217; The writings of George Fox, the founder of
Quakerism, mostly belong to a previous period; but the
<i>No Cross, no Crown</i> of William Penn (1644-1718) falls
within Restoration literature. A far more important work
is the <i>Apology</i> of Robert Barclay (1648-1690). This
remarkable book, which has been recommended by bishops
to theological students as the best available for many purposes,
is the standard exposition of Quakerism, and undoubtedly
ranks among the classics of its period. Mr.
Leslie Stephen describes it as &#8216;one of the most impressive
theological writings of the century: grave, logical, and
often marked by the eloquence of lofty moral convictions.&#8217;
&#8216;The St. Paul of the Quakers,&#8217; says Coleridge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
author. Barclay, the descendant of an old Scotch family,
became a Quaker in 1667, following the example of his
father. He underwent some persecution, but was in the
main shielded by the favour of James II. His works were
collected by Penn in 1692.</p>

<p>Two devotional writings of the age, besides Baxter&#8217;s,
obtained sufficient currency to merit a place in the history
of literature. <i>The Whole Duty of Man</i>, first published in
1658, is an excellent representative of the sobriety and
sound sense characteristic of the Church of England. At
the same time it must be confessed that it has more reason
than unction, and seeks rather to menace and upbraid than
to allure men into the religious life. At the present day
it would be pronounced grievously deficient in fervour,
servile in its political teachings, and too exclusive in its
appeals to prudential and self-interested motives; but its
adaptation to a positive and prosaic age was sufficiently
evinced by a circulation enormous for the period. The
authorship is involved in mystery: it is usually attributed
to Archbishop Sterne or Lady Pakington; but Sterne can
hardly have had time to write the seven other treatises
ascribed, apparently with good ground, to the same author;
and it is clearly not the composition of a woman. Evelyn
attributes it on the authority of Archbishop Tenison to a
Dr. Chaplin, of University College, Oxford, who cannot be
traced. Lately Mr. Dobie, in the <i>Academy</i>, has ascribed it
and its companions on strong grounds to Richard Allestree,
Provost of Eton, an intimate friend of Bishop Fell. The
Bishop appears to have copied some of them in his own
hand, and certainly was acquainted with the authorship.
The most important of the other works ascribed to the
writer of <i>The Whole Duty of Man</i> are <i>The Causes of the
Decay of Christian Piety</i>, <i>The Gentleman and Ladies&#8217; Calling</i>,
and <i>The Government of the Tongue</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Another work of edification, which almost rivalled the
popularity of <i>The Whole Duty of Man</i>, was the <i>Practical
Discourse concerning Death</i> (1689), by William Sherlock
(1641-1707), Master of the Temple and Dean of St. Paul&#8217;s,
the divine whose tergiversations respecting the oath of
allegiance to William and Mary are so amusingly detailed
by Macaulay. It is a model of clear and forcible writing,
but on the lowest plane of unspiritual selfishness. &#8216;How unreasonable
is it for us to trouble ourselves about this world
longer than we are like to continue in it!&#8217; exclaims Sherlock,
with the air of one apologizing for enunciating a truism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Ray
(1628-1705).</div>

<p>Natural theology had a representative of much higher
moral calibre than professional theology found
in Sherlock in John Ray (1628-1705). Ray,
a Cambridge man, prevented by scruples from
ministering in the Church of England after the fatal
legislation of 1662, but substantially accepting her doctrines,
was the first English naturalist of eminence, and
wrote chiefly in Latin, but composed his treatise on <i>The
Wisdom of God in the Creation</i> in his mother-tongue.
The anthropomorphism of this earnest, lucid, and ingenious
book, the prototype of Paley&#8217;s, is a defect hardly to be
avoided in an age when the Deity was almost universally
conceived as an artificer; and yet Ray comes very near
indeed to the conception of a power immanent in Nature.
His style is limpid and persuasive; his reasoning cogent;
his good sense is apparent in his discussion of spontaneous
generation and the stories related in its support, although
the caution and modesty of his temper sometimes incline
him to defer too much to authority. He has no mercy, for
example, on frogs rained from the sky, but will not, in the
face of the testimony of eye-witnesses, carry scepticism to
the point of disputing that they may have been occasionally
found immured in the middle of stones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Ray&#8217;s teleology had allies in Derham (1657-1735), an
observant naturalist and author of <i>Astro-Theology</i>, and in
the Hon. Robert Boyle, the best of men in disposition, and
an admirable natural philosopher, but feeble and diffuse
as a natural theologian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Burnet
(1635?-1715).</div>

<p>Thomas Burnet, Master of the Charter House, is the reverse
of Boyle in most respects; a visionary
as natural theologian and natural philosopher,
but the only writer of his day, the
great preachers excepted, who attained to sublimity in prose.
A Cambridge man and a pupil of Tillotson, Burnet was
elected Master of the Charter House in 1685, and signalized
himself by his courage in resisting James II.&#8217;s
attempted intrusion of Roman Catholics into the foundation.
He became Clerk of the Closet to William III.,
which post he was obliged to resign from the freedom of
his criticism of the Mosaic narrative, but retained his
mastership unmolested to his death. He left behind him
two theological works in Latin, privately printed, but soon
afterwards published, <i>De Fide et officiis Christianorum</i> and
<i>De Statu mortuorum et resurgentium</i>, in which he carried
the liberty of speculation very far. The book on which his
fame rests, <i>The Sacred Theory of the Earth</i>, was also originally
composed in Latin, to which circumstance it is probably
indebted for much of its exceptional dignity of style.
It was intended by the author as sober natural philosophy,
but to a scientific age appears a poetical vision of the
former immersion and future conflagration of the earth,
justly compared by Mr. Gosse to the gorgeous apocalyptic
imaginings of Danby and Martin. According to Burnet
the earth was originally an egg both in shape and smoothness,
enclosing the waters in an &#8216;antediluvian abyss.&#8217; At
the universal deluge the earth sank into this internal cavity.
Upon the subsidence of the waters the land partly emerged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
in the confused shapes into which it had been tumbled
by the crash, partly remained beneath the sea. The argument
is very ingenious and entertaining, and instructive
also, for it exhibits to perfection two of the most
ordinary causes of fallacy, the assuming imaginary data
as unquestionable premises and the enthusiast&#8217;s adoption
of sublimity as the standard of truth. Burnet&#8217;s mind
was the mind of a poet; he had just enough science to
misguide him, and more than enough learning to gloss
over the vagaries of his science. He is quite as much at
home in expounding the catastrophe of the future, the
final conflagration, as the watery catastrophe of which he
believes the traces to be visible everywhere around him.
At the same time he has a strong affinity to the rationalizing
divines, even more visible in his strictly theological
writings, and would not for the world propound anything
of whose reasonableness he has not first convinced himself.
As a writer he stands high, combining the splendour and
melody of a former age with the ease and lucidity of his
own. The following is a fair average specimen of his
picturesque imagination and impassioned diction:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Thus the Flood came to its height; and &#8217;tis not easy to represent
to ourselves this strange scene of things, when the Deluge
was in its fury and extremity; when the earth was broken and
swallowed up in the abyss, whose raging waters rose higher than
the mountains, and filled the air with broken waves, with an
universal mist, and with thick darkness, so as nature seemed to
be in a second chaos; and upon this chaos rid the distrest Ark,
that bore the small remains of mankind. No sea was ever so
tumultuous, as this, nor is there anything in present nature to
be compared with the disorder of these waters; all the poetry,
and all the hyperboles that are used in the description of storms
and raging seas, were literally true in this, if not beneath it.
The Ark was really carried to the tops of the highest mountains,
and into the places of the clouds, and thrown down again into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the deepest gulfs; and to this very state of the Deluge and of
the Ark, which was a type of the Church in this world, David
seems to have alluded in the name of the Church, Psalm xlii. 7,
Abyss calls upon abyss at the noise of thy cataracts or waterspouts;
all thy waves and billows have gone over me. It was
no doubt an extraordinary and miraculous providence, that
could make a vessel, so ill manned, live upon such a sea; that
kept it from being dashed against the hills, or overwhelmed in
the deeps. That abyss which had devoured and swallowed up
whole forests of woods, cities, and provinces, nay the whole
earth, when it had conquered all, and triumphed over all, could
not destroy this single ship. I remember in the story of the
Argonautics, Dion. Argonaut. l. i., v. 47, when Jason set out to
fetch the Golden Fleece, the poet saith, all the gods that day
looked down from Heaven to view the ship, and the nymphs
stood upon the mountain-tops to see the noble youth of Thessaly
pulling at the oars; we may with more reason suppose the good
angels to have looked down upon this ship of Noah&#8217;s; and that
not out of curiosity, as idle spectators, but with a passionate
concern for its safety and deliverance. A ship, whose cargo was
no less than a whole world; that carried the fortune and hopes
of all posterity, and if this had perished, the earth for any thing
we know had been nothing but a desert, a great ruin, a dead
heap of rubbish, from the Deluge to the conflagration. But
death and hell, the grave, and destruction have their bounds.
We may entertain ourselves with the consideration of the face of
the Deluge, and of the broken and drowned earth, in this scheme,
with the floating Ark, and the guardian angels.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>The most eminent natural theologian of the time after
Ray, and one who would have surpassed Ray in importance
if his labours in this department had been more than a
brief episode in a busy career, was Richard Bentley, whose
power of destructive criticism in other fields proved how
formidable a champion he could be on the negative side of
any question. Bentley&#8217;s massive intelligence, however,
aptitude for broad commonsense views, and impatience of
niceties and subtleties, entirely qualified him to embrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and expound the form in which natural theology commended
itself to the vast majority of the thinkers of his
day. He dealt solely with the materialism of Hobbes,
&#8216;there may be some Spinosists beyond seas,&#8217; he says, but
to him <i>de non existentibus, et de non apparentibus, eadem
est ratio</i>. The questions and the answers of a Goethe would
have been equally unintelligible to him; if Newman would
certainly have thought him shallow, he would as certainly
have thought Newman whimsical. He must be judged
from the standpoint of his own day, and from this his
argument, delivered as the Boyle lecture for 1691 and
1692, must be pronounced a splendid and cogent piece of
reasoning. It is particularly remarkable for its absolute
reliance on the doctrines of Newton&#8217;s <i>Principia</i>, when
Newton had hardly a disciple out of England.</p>

<span class="smaller">BUNYAN AND OTHER WRITERS OF FICTION.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">John Bunyan
(1628-1688).</div>

<p>So great an endowment is genius, that neither the effect
produced nor the fame achieved by all the eloquent and
learned divines of Charles II.&#8217;s age can be for an instant
compared to the achievement of a poor and almost illiterate
mechanic, whom Macaulay classes with Milton as one of
the only two men of that period&mdash;he might have excepted
Thomas Burnet&mdash;to whom had been vouchsafed any considerable
measure of imagination. John Bunyan, the one
man who has attained to write a successful
prose allegory on a large scale, and to infuse
true emotion into an exercise of ingenuity, and
who probably owed less to study and training than any other
of the great authors of the modern world, was born at Elstow,
a village in the neighbourhood of Bedford, in November,
1628. He is usually described as a &#8216;tinker,&#8217; but, as he was
not an itinerant, &#8216;brazier&#8217; would be a more correct appellation.
The trade was his father&#8217;s, who was also a very small
freeholder. Bunyan probably received some instruction at
Bedford grammar school, and his narrative of his boyhood
shows that he must have had considerable knowledge of
the Bible, which impressed his imaginative temper more
than he knew at the time. According to his own account
he was wild and profane in his youth, but nothing very
definite can be extracted from these self-accusations, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
would rather appear that it was only for a short time that
he could even be described as careless. In 1644, partly perhaps
from grief at the death of his mother and dissatisfaction
with his father&#8217;s speedy re-marriage, he enlisted into
the army, doubtless the Parliamentary force, though he
strangely or prudently leaves the point uncertain. About
the end of 1648 he married, and through the influence of
his wife, whose name he does not tell us, and by the aid of
two religious books which she brought him among her
scanty possessions, he accomplished what he afterwards
came to consider a merely outward reformation. The
attempt to subjugate the inward man involved him for
several years in the most distressing spiritual conflicts,
described with extreme power in his <i>Grace Abounding</i>.
They conducted him eventually to peace, and into the
Baptist congregation of Mr. Gifford, who had been helpful
to him. In 1655 he became a preacher, and in the following
year produced his first book, <i>Some Gospel Truths
Opened</i>, to which was prefixed a recommendatory letter by
John Burton, who says, &#8216;This man is not chosen out of an
earthly, but out of the heavenly university.&#8217;</p>

<p>In 1660 the revival under the Restoration government
of obsolete enactments against conventicles, with no endeavour
to discriminate between seditious conspirators
like the Fifth Monarchy men and harmless worshippers
like the Baptists, compelled the reluctant Bedford magistrates
to arrest and imprison Bunyan as an unlicensed
preacher. He might have escaped, or have obtained
release by a trifling submission, but with the spirit of a
Christian martyr he disdained either course, and abode
contentedly in prison for nearly twelve years. His captivity
in the commodious county gaol was by no means
oppressive; indeed, in the first part of it he enjoyed a
large measure of liberty, afterwards withdrawn. He sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>ported
himself by making tagged laces, as well as by the
publication of some books, of which <i>Grace Abounding</i>
(1666) is the most important. The first part of <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress</i> was also written in prison, but, as Bunyan&#8217;s best
biographer, Dr. John Brown, almost proves, during a
second and comparatively brief confinement in 1676. In
1672 Bunyan published his <i>Defence of Justification by
Faith</i>, a coarse and violent attack on the <i>Design of Christianity</i>,
by Dr., afterwards Bishop Fowler, one of the most
tolerant divines of the age, but who was provoked to
reply with almost equal acrimony. In the same year
Charles II.&#8217;s merciful but entirely illegal suspension of
all statutes against Papists and Nonconformists liberated
Bunyan, who even obtained a licence to preach, and became
stated minister of the Baptist congregation at
Bedford, then meeting in a barn in an orchard. Notwithstanding
some few molestations, of which the second
imprisonment in 1675-76 was the chief, the remainder of
his life was in general tranquil and prosperous. The first
part of <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i> appeared in 1678, and, though
not half-a-dozen copies of it are now known to exist,
immediately attained the highest popularity. Edition
followed edition, the first two or three with remarkable
additions and improvements. Bunyan frequently visited
London, where he became a popular preacher; his influence
was courted, though unsuccessfully, by the government
itself, and in 1688, the year of his death, he had become
in some sort chaplain to the Lord Mayor, &#8216;an Anabaptist,
a very odd ignorant person,&#8217; says Evelyn. His principal
works in the interval had been: <i>The Life and Death of
Mr. Badman</i>, 1680; <i>The Holy War</i>, 1682; the second part
of the <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>, 1684; <i>The Jerusalem Sinner
Saved</i>, 1688. His death, on August 31st, 1688, took place
in London, and was occasioned by cold contracted on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
journey which he had undertaken to reconcile a father
with his son.</p>

<p>Of Bunyan&#8217;s character there can be but one opinion, he
was a truly Apostolic man. As no one&#8217;s diction is more
forcible, unadulterated Saxon, so no life has better expressed
the sturdy, sterling virtues of the Englishman.
A wider culture would have enriched both his mind and
his writings, but with the probable result of turning a
remarkable man into an ordinary one. His good sense
and his humility are illustrated by a charming anecdote.
&#8216;Ah, Mr. Bunyan,&#8217; said a grateful hearer, &#8216;that was a
sweet sermon!&#8217; &#8216;You need not tell me that,&#8217; replied
Bunyan, &#8216;the devil whispered it to me before I was well
out of the pulpit.&#8217;</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to dwell at any great length upon the
characteristics of so famous and universally known a book
as <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>. Though professedly a vision, and
treating of spiritual things, it ranks with <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>
and <i>Gulliver&#8217;s Travels</i> as one of the great realistic books
of the English language. All three are examples of the
possibility of rendering scenes wholly imaginary, and in
fact impossible, truer to the apprehension than experience
itself by the narrator&#8217;s own air of absolute conviction, and
by unswerving fidelity to truth of detail. In Bunyan&#8217;s
case the triumph is the more remarkable, as his personages
are not even imaginary men and women, but
mere embodiments of moral or theological qualities. Yet
Faithful and Hopeful are as real as Crusoe and Friday.
Before he began to write he must have realized what he
wished to describe with a vividness only conceivable by
regarding it as an outward expression of his own spiritual
experience. He had himself been Christian and Faithful
and the captive in Doubting Castle; he had gazed on
Vanity Fair, and passed through the Valley of the Shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
of Death. The fact that his allegory is in truth an autobiography
explains what Macaulay calls the characteristic
peculiarity of <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>: &#8216;it is the only work of
its kind which possesses a strong human interest. Other
allegories only amuse the fancy. The allegory of Bunyan
has been read by many thousands with tears.&#8217; Elsewhere
he says, &#8216;<i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i> is perhaps the only book about
which, after the lapse of a hundred years, the educated
minority has come over to the opinion of the common
people.&#8217; It may be added that <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>, unlike
other celebrated works, is a <i>bona fide</i> and unmistakable
allegory. <i>Don Quixote</i> may have a much deeper purpose
than that of satirizing chivalric romances, but not one
reader in a hundred cares to fathom it. Spenser undoubtedly
intended to shadow forth Elizabeth in Gloriana;
but the perception of the poet&#8217;s purpose contributes
nothing to the enjoyment of his poem. In Bunyan, however,
the allegory is the book, too plain to be overlooked
by the most careless reader; and all the minor allegories
that combine to enrich the main action are equally apparent
for what they are, and yet the obvious invention has
all the force of reality. &#8216;Bunyan,&#8217; says Macaulay, &#8216;is
almost the only writer who ever gave to the abstract the
interest of the concrete. In the works of many celebrated
authors men are mere personifications. The mind of
Bunyan, on the other hand, was so imaginative that personifications,
when he dealt with them, became men. A
dialogue between two qualities, in his dream, has more
dramatic effect than a dialogue between two human beings
in most plays.&#8217; Macaulay proceeds to compare Bunyan
in this particular with Shelley, and the comparison is just;
but it is surprising that neither he nor Mr. Froude should
have dwelt on Bunyan&#8217;s deeper affinity to a great predecessor
of whom he assuredly never read a line&mdash;Dante.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Dante&#8217;s personifications, indeed, are feeble compared to
Bunyan&#8217;s; it is doubtful whether some of them are even
intended as such. The might of his imagination, however,
like Bunyan&#8217;s, is shown in his power of reconciling us to
its wildest flights by the intensity of his realism; and the
chief distinction is that while Bunyan&#8217;s materials are
necessarily drawn from the only worlds he knew, the
narrow and prosaic world of Bedford and the sublime
world of the Bible, Dante disposed of all his age could
give in philosophy, political life, human learning, the
influence of art and the scrutiny of nature. Bunyan is
hence a very contracted and terrestrial Dante, but so far
as he goes he is a true Dante; he cannot soar with his
great predecessor, but if Dante had succeeded him he
would not have disdained to have built upon his massive
groundwork. Both suffer from the inevitable progress of
mankind beyond the conceptions which in their day were
accepted as matters of course. Dante&#8217;s <i>Inferno</i> now seems
rather grotesque than terrible. Christian&#8217;s forsaking his
kindred in the City of Destruction, which to Bunyan
appeared a duty, now seems selfishness. That the fame
of both should have survived such profound modifications
of belief is one of the most striking evidences of their
greatness. One great advantage Bunyan possessed: the
Bible had prepared the way for him. There is probably
no other such instance of the assimilation of one literature
by another as the domestication of the Bible in England.
The Greek and Hebrew authors of the Scriptures were
better known to the public that Bunyan principally
addressed than the majority of their own writers, and he
had no need, like other men of original genius, to painfully
create the taste by which he was ultimately to be
judged. From the first <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i> took rank as a
classic; well might Dr. Arnold call it &#8216;a complete reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of Scripture.&#8217; Its chief blemish, the somewhat prosaic and
self-seeking character of its piety, harmonized entirely with
the current teaching of the pulpit, and offered no stumbling-block
to a generation which had not so much as heard of
&#8216;other-worldliness.&#8217; Its popularity soon received the usual
attestation of piracies, spurious continuations, and imitations
in all languages. The question whether Bunyan was
indebted for his allegory to any predecessor is hardly worth
discussing. Some general resemblance must necessarily
exist between books treating of pilgrimages, and here the
resemblance is no more than general. The second part
was published in 1684. Its inferiority to the first part is
universally admitted, but is less than is usually entailed
by the endeavour to append an artificial supplement to an
inspired book. Many passages are fully worthy of the
first part, and as a whole it abounds with life and variety.</p>

<p>Three only of Bunyan&#8217;s numerous publications, besides
<i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>, claim a place in literature: <i>The Holy
War</i> (1682); <i>The Life and Death of Mr. Badman</i> (1680);
<i>Grace Abounding</i> (1665). Of these <i>The Holy War</i> is the
most important, and affords a highly instructive contrast
with <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>. It is the peculiar virtue of the
latter, while full of wisdom and profitableness, to be in no
way professedly didactic. Bunyan himself tells us that he
did not sit down to compose it; the thoughts came spontaneously
into his mind; he wrote it because he could not
help himself. There was thus no need for laboriously instilling
lessons which inhered in the original conception,
and came forward of themselves as the story flowed along.
The elaborate construction of <i>The Holy War</i> precludes
belief in a like inspiration. There can, in fact, be little
doubt that the idea is consciously derived from <i>Paradise
Lost</i>. In both the banished fiends cast about for some means
of retaliating upon their omnipotent foe; in Milton their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
attack is levelled against the Garden of Eden, in Bunyan
against the soul of man. All human attributes, virtuous
or vicious, are allegorized with graphic liveliness, but at
length one wearies of the crowd of abstractions; and where
strength was most necessary, Bunyan is weak. Emanuel
is not godlike, and Diabolus is not terrible. The book is
perhaps chiefly interesting as an index to the great progress
effected since Bunyan&#8217;s time in spirituality as regards
men&#8217;s religious conceptions, and in freedom and enlightenment
as concerns the things of earth. No one would now
depict the offended majesty of Heaven as so like the
offended majesty of the Stuarts; or deem that the revolters&#8217;
offence could be mitigated by the abjectness of their submission;
or try criminals with such unfairness; or lecture
them upon conviction with such lack of judicial decorum.
Bunyan&#8217;s own spirit seems narrower than of old; among
the traitors upon whom Emanuel&#8217;s ministers execute justice
he includes not only Notruth and Pitiless, but also
Election-doubter and Vocation-doubter, who represent the
majority of the members of the Church of England. The
whole tone, in truth, is such as might be expected from one
nurtured upon the Old rather than the New Testament,
and who had never conceived any doubts of the justice of
the Israelites&#8217; dealings with the Canaanites. The literary
power, nevertheless, is unabated; much ingenuity is shown
in keeping up the interest of the story; and there is the
old gift of vitalizing abstractions by uncompromising
realism of treatment. The following passage is a remarkable
instance of the dependence of Bunyan&#8217;s style upon his
inward mind. Seldom have joy and elation of spirit
elevated homely diction into so near an approach to
magnificence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>&#8216;Well, I told you before, how the prisoners were entertained
by the noble Prince Emmanuel, and how they behaved themselves
before him, and how he sent them away to their home with pipe
and tabor going before them. And now you must think, that
those of the town that had all this while waited to hear of their
death, could not but be exercised with sadness of mind, and
with thoughts that pricked like thorns. Nor could their
thoughts be kept to one point; the wind blew with them all this
while at great uncertainties, yea, their hearts were like a balance
that had been disquieted with shaking hand. But at last as
they, with many a long look, looked over the wall of Mansoul,
they thought that they saw some returning to the town; and
thought again, who should they be? At last they discerned
that they were the prisoners. But can you imagine, how their
hearts were surprised with wonder! Especially when they perceived
also in what equipage, and with what honour they were
sent home. They went down to the camp in black, but they
came back to the town in white; they went down to the camp
in ropes, they came back in chains of gold; they went down to
the camp with their feet in tatters, but they came back with
their steps enlarged under them; they went also to the camp
looking for death, but they came back from thence with assurance
of life; they went down to the camp with heavy hearts, but
came back again with pipe and tabor playing before them. So,
so soon as they were come to Eye-gate, the poor and tottering
town of Mansoul adventured to give a shout; and they gave
such a shout, as made the captains in the Prince&#8217;s army leap at
the sound thereof. Alas! for them, poor hearts, who could
blame them, since their dead friends were come to life again!
For it was to them as life from the dead, to see the ancients of
the town of Mansoul to shine in such splendour. They looked
for nothing but the axe and the block; but behold! joy and
gladness, comfort and consolation, and such melodious notes
attending of them, that was sufficient to make a sick man well.
So when they came up, they saluted each other with Welcome,
welcome, and blessed be he that spared you. They added also,
we see it is well with you, but how must it go with the town of
Mansoul, and will it go well with the town of Mansoul, said
they? Then answered them the Recorder, and my lord Mayor,
Oh! tidings! glad tidings! good tidings of good; and of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
joy to poor Mansoul! Then they gave another shout, that made
the earth to ring again. After this, they enquired yet more particularly,
how things went in the camp, and what message they
had from Emmanuel to the town. So they told them all passages
that had happened to them at the camp, and every thing that
the Prince did to them. This made Mansoul wonder at the
wisdom and grace of the Prince Emmanuel; then they told
them what they had received at his hands, for the whole town of
Mansoul; and the Recorder delivered it in these words, Pardon,
Pardon, Pardon for Mansoul; and this shall Mansoul know to-morrow.
Then he commanded, and they went and summoned
Mansoul to meet together in the market-place to-morrow, there
to hear their general pardon read.</p>

<p>&#8216;But who can think what a turn, what a change, what an
alteration this hint of things did make in the countenance of the
town of Mansoul; no man of Mansoul could sleep that night for
joy; in every house there was joy and music, singing and making
merry, telling and hearing of Mansoul&#8217;s happiness was then all
that Mansoul had to do; and this was the burden of all their
song, &#8220;Oh! more of this at the rising of the sun! more of this
to-morrow! Who thought yesterday, would one say, that this day
would have been such a day to us? And who thought, that
saw our prisoners go down in irons, that they would have
returned in chains of gold! Yea, they that judged themselves as
they went to be judged of their judge, were, by his mouth,
acquitted, not for that they were innocent, but of the Prince&#8217;s
mercy, and sent home with pipe and tabor.&#8221;&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Life and Death of Mr. Badman</i> is a piece of prose
indeed, and its realism is, perhaps, the more effective from
being wholly devoid of the least particle of imagination.
The genesis and purpose of the book are thus stated by the
author: &#8216;As I was considering with myself what I had
written concerning the progress of the Pilgrim from this
world to glory, and how it had been acceptable to many in
this nation, it came again into my mind to write, as then
of him that was going to heaven, so now of the life and
death of the ungodly, and of their travel from this world to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
hell.&#8217; Had this conception been strictly carried out, the narrative
must have been a failure from the want of admixture of
light and shade. The Christian of the <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i> is
a mixed character, and though we are scarcely in doubt as
to the ultimate success of his adventure, this is sufficiently
chequered with peril and hardship to keep our interest
alert. This evidently cannot be the case with Mr. Badman,
whose career is not only a monotony, but a monotony of
sordid evil; and who only excites a flickering sort of
interest in virtue of the sympathy naturally felt for the
victim of the animosity of his creator. Bunyan, however,
has not been faithful to his original plan, and has in a
measure redeemed one fault in art by committing another.
As a rule, nothing is more reprehensible in a fiction than
inordinate digression; but here it is the greatest relief to
be turned away from the repulsive career of Mr. Badman
to the running commentary in which Bunyan opens his
mind on a variety of subjects, spiritual and secular, ranging
from earnest rebukes of the maxim to be anon formulated
as &#8216;buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest,&#8217; to
foolish stories of the deaths of persecutors, quite in the
vein of the Methodist anecdotes satirized by Sydney Smith.
This garrulity is greatly promoted by the inartistic
character of the machinery employed, a dialogue between
Mr. Wiseman and Mr. Attentive, which allows the writer
to say whatever he pleases. It is evident that he has real
persons and actual transactions continually in his mind,
and it would not be surprising to learn that his book
made no inconsiderable commotion in the town of
Bedford.</p>

<p><i>Grace Abounding</i> resembles thousands of similar narratives
in essentials, differing principally in the vigour with
which a terrifying religious experience is portrayed. It
does not, as some seem to have taken for granted, termi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>nate
with what would be technically considered as Bunyan&#8217;s
conversion; on the contrary, a large portion is employed in
recording his agonies of apprehension long after he had
become a recognized religious instructor, even so late as the
beginning of his imprisonment, when he was so little
acquainted with the law as to suppose himself in jeopardy of
the gallows. Much might be said in censure or compassion
of his lamentably distorted views of divine things; but one
thing cannot be said: there is not from first to last the
slightest symptom of cant. The book is more sincere than
Rousseau&#8217;s <i>Confessions</i>, but could not, like that book, have
helped a Carlyle or a George Eliot to learn that there was
something in them. As <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i> may be termed
a prosaic Divine Comedy, so might the Bunyan of <i>Grace
Abounding</i> rank as a prosaic Augustine, but an Augustine
without a Monica. With the rarest exceptions, self is its
beginning, middle, and end; it is only when the author for
a space becomes, unlike Cardinal Newman, conscious of the
existence of something besides God and his own soul, that
we catch the real moral of his tale, which he himself was
far from intending or perceiving. In his own incomparably
forcible words: &#8216;I went myself in chains to preach to
them in chains; and carried that fire in my own conscience
that I persuaded them to beware of. I can truly say, and
that without dissembling, that when I have been to preach
I have gone full of guilt and terror even to the pulpit-door,
and there it hath been taken off; and I have been at
liberty in my mind until I have done my work, and
then immediately, even before I could get down the
pulpit-stairs, I have been as bad as I was before.&#8217;
What is this but to own that self-seeking is unprofitable
even when cloaked with piety and contrition;
that there is no true peace save in disinterested service?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aphra Behn
(1640-1689).</div>

<p>Violent indeed is the transition from John Bunyan
to Aphra Behn, but in fact the living fiction
of the age is almost summed up in these
two names. But for the demonstration of
the contrary afforded by the state of French literature
since 1830, one would almost have been inclined to formulate
it as a maxim that the drama and the novel
cannot flourish together. The almost utter barrenness
of the Restoration age in the latter class of literature
is certainly very remarkable. All needful conditions
seemed present in a teeming national life, clever writers,
and a public that craved to be amused. It seems difficult
to offer any explanation except that it had as yet
occurred to none to depart from French models, and that
the French exemplars of the day, like Samuel Weller, disdained
all under the degree of &#8216;a female markis.&#8217; Hence
the healthy realism without which the English novel
cannot prosper was impossible, and it was left to the
Fieldings and Smolletts of the next age to effect a momentous
revolution in art by the simple discovery that for
the novelist&#8217;s purpose, &#8216;Jack was as good as his master.&#8217;
One variety of fiction, apparently still popular at the
Restoration, gradually died out&mdash;the interminable romance
of the Clelia class, by which French polite society under
Louis XIII. had replaced the exploded romance of
chivalry. Of the few examples of this which English
literature still produced, it will suffice to name Lord
Orrery&#8217;s <i>Parthenissa</i>, whose heroine, as an example of
chastity, lived long enough to be dethroned by Pamela.
Mrs. Behn&#8217;s tales, it need not be said, are constructed upon
principles in every respect antipodal to <i>Parthenissa</i>; they
are, however, much less objectionable than her comedies.
They are on the French pattern, brief and bright, but
inevitably conventional. At the present day, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
when the disuse of an equally conventional fashion is
restoring action to the rank from which it had been almost
displaced by dialogue, Mrs. Behn&#8217;s tales might be not unprofitably
read as examples of movement and condensation;
and occasionally of strong situation, of which she rarely
makes the most. The most celebrated is <i>Oroonoko</i>, the
groundwork of Southern&#8217;s play, and itself founded on facts
within the authoress&#8217;s knowledge. Among other remarkable
passages is one descriptive of the effects of the electric
eel. Mrs. Behn&#8217;s stories are types of a large number of
miniature romances, apparently little noticed in their own
day, and utterly unknown in ours, which they have not
always reached in other fashion than Protus&#8217;s</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>&#8216;This class of literature,&#8217; says Mr. Gosse, &#8216;was treated
with marked disdain, and having been read to pieces
by the women, was thrown into the fire.&#8217; One specimen,
<i>Incognita</i>, deserves a word of mention as the first work of the
youthful Congreve. Some variety was introduced into
pure fiction by the importation from France by Mrs.
Manley, already mentioned as a dramatist, of the political
novel, in which the actions of living monarchs and statesmen
were represented under transparent disguises. The
presses of Amsterdam and Cologne had long teemed with
such productions, and Mrs. Manley&#8217;s <i>Atalanta</i> and <i>Zarah</i>
are conspicuous English examples. Another romance, <i>A
New and further Discovery of the Isle of Pines</i>, in a letter
professing to emanate from Cornelius van Sloetton, a
Dutchman (1668), deserves some attention from its possible
influence on Defoe. It has been represented to be
connected with Australian discovery, with which it has in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
fact nothing to do, the imaginary island being placed in
the very centre of the Indian Ocean. It afforded the
theme for Voltaire&#8217;s joke about the Englishman <i>qui travaillait
si bien</i> that the island on which he was wrecked was
shortly afterwards found to be peopled by twelve thousand
English Protestants.</p>

<span class="smaller">ESSAYISTS AND LETTER WRITERS, LITERARY HISTORIANS.</span></h2>

<p>The most important part of the posthumous papers of
Samuel Butler, the discovery of which in the eighteenth
century has been mentioned, was his <i>Characters</i>, composed
upon the model of Theophrastus, and fairly entitling him
to the appellation of the English Theophrastus, which is
not the highest encomium imaginable. As the only work
of the kind which has come down to us from antiquity,
the <i>Characters</i> of Theophrastus, which are in reality much
later than the time of that successor of Aristotle, have
passed as models, a reputation in excess of their desert.
They offer an acute and entertaining enumeration of
various peculiarities of character, but do not succeed in
presenting the personage as a whole, and have much the
air of being compiled from traits delineated with a real
truth of representation by the comic poets. Butler&#8217;s
<i>Characters</i> are of just the same kind, and his work is
rather a museum of particulars than a gallery of portraits.
The age of Charles II. by no means lives in him as the age
of Anne lives in Addison. La Bruyre, Butler&#8217;s more
celebrated French successor, who certainly never read and
probably never heard of him, fell into precisely the same
error from too timid an adherence to Theophrastus; and
the improvement upon him effected by Addison may be
compared to the service rendered to sculpture by Ddalus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the first, it is said, to show the human form in motion.
Isolated remarks in Butler&#8217;s essays are frequently very
shrewd and pregnant; as when he says of the newsmonger,
&#8216;He would willingly bear his share in any public calamity
to have the pleasure of hearing and telling it;&#8217; or of the
hunter, &#8216;Let the hare take which way she will, she seldom
fails to lead him at long-running to the alehouse;&#8217; or the
description of a prince&#8217;s unworthy favourite as &#8216;a fog
raised by the sun to obscure his own brightness.&#8217; Many
of Butler&#8217;s miscellaneous thoughts, appended to the <i>Characters</i>,
are highly acute, and exhibit a happy talent for
illustrating abstract ideas by comparison with sensible
objects, as for instance: &#8216;Oaths and obligations in the
affairs of the world are like ribands and knots in dressing,
that seem to tie something, but do not.&#8217; In politics Butler
is, of course, a loyalist, and one whose loyalty is intensified
by his sthetic dislike to Puritanism, in which he was
constitutionally incapable of seeing anything but cant.
At the same time, the contempt which as a man of understanding
he could not help entertaining for the conduct of
affairs under the Restoration, and disappointment at the
neglect with which he was himself treated, seem to have
almost reduced him to a condition of political scepticism.
&#8216;The worst governments are the best when they light in
good hands; and the best the worst, when they fall into
bad ones&#8217;&mdash;a remark condensed into a famous couplet by
Pope, who appears to have become acquainted with Butler&#8217;s
MS. through Atterbury. It is worth observing that Butler
not only prefers Ben Jonson to Shakespeare, but seems to
take his superiority for granted: &#8216;Virgil, who wanted
much of that natural easiness of wit that Ovid had, did
nevertheless with hard labour and long study arrive at a
higher perfection than the other with all his dexterity of
wit, but less industry, could attain to. The same we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
observe of Jonson and Shakespeare; for he that is able to
think long and judge well will be sure to find out better
things than another man can hit upon suddenly, though of
more quick and ready parts, which is commonly but chance,
and the other art and judgment.&#8217; One special distinction
of Butler&#8217;s is to have been perhaps the first English satirist
of mark who made parody a political weapon, or at least
showed its capabilities for this purpose, as it does not
appear that any of his political parodies were printed in
his lifetime. Jack Cade&#8217;s speeches in Shakespeare are,
indeed, a sufficient model, but Butler worked out the hint
elaborately in his fictitious speeches in the Rump Parliament;
his mock eulogium of this body or segment of a
body in the oration supposed to be delivered at Harrington&#8217;s
Rota; and the parody of Prynne&#8217;s style in the
imaginary correspondence between him and John Audland,
the Quaker.</p>

<p>Butler&#8217;s remains were only partially printed in 1759,
but the MSS. from which Thyer&#8217;s publication was drawn
were acquired in 1885 by the British Museum. His selection
seems to have been in general exceedingly judicious,
but the opportunity may be taken of giving some examples
of Butler&#8217;s unpublished thoughts:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;There is no better argument to prove that the Scriptures
were written by divine inspiration than that excellent saying of
our Saviour, If any man will go to law with thee for thy cloak,
give him thy coat also.</p>

<p>&#8216;Birds are taken with pipes that imitate their own voices,
and men with those sayings that are most agreeable to their own
opinions.</p>

<p>&#8216;If the French nobility should follow our fashions, and send
their children over to learn our language, and receive their
education from us, we should have as glorious an opinion of
ourselves, and as mean a value of them, as they have of us; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
therefore we have no reason to blame them, but our own folly
for it.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to learn Butler&#8217;s opinion of Dryden as
a critic:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Dryden weighs poets in his virtuoso&#8217;s scales that will weigh
to the hundredth part of a grain, as curiously as Juvenal&#8217;s lady
pedantess&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Atque alia parte in trutina suspendit Homerum.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He complained of Ben Jonson for stealing scenes out of Plautus.
Set a thief to find out a thief.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>George Savile, Marquis of Halifax, who ranks with
Shaftesbury and Temple among the few politicians of that
age entitled to the appellation of statesman, enriched English
literature with a small volume of essays, the most important
of which are his vindication of his own political course and
principles in <i>The Character of a Trimmer</i> and <i>The Anatomy
of an Equivalent</i>. Of these Macaulay justly says: &#8216;What
particularly strikes us is the writer&#8217;s passion for generalization.
He was treating of the most exciting subjects in the
most agitated times; he was himself placed in the very
thick of the civil conflict; yet there is no acrimony, nothing
inflammatory, nothing personal. He treats every question
as an abstract question, begins with the widest propositions,
argues these propositions on general grounds, and
often, when he has brought out his theorem, leaves the
reader to make the application, without adding an allusion
to particular men or to passing events.&#8217; The effect of this
remarkable breadth of view was not with Halifax, as so

comprehensive mind unfit for practical action. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
not retained in equilibrium by the difficulty of deciding
between two courses, but was an enthusiast for the <i>via
media</i>, as great a zealot for compromise as zealots commonly
are for strong measures; and, though sometimes
too yielding or too speculative for the unquiet times in
which his lot was cast, would have made an almost ideal
prime minister for the nineteenth century. His praise of
trimming, which to more fiery spirits must have seemed
an ignoble policy, rings with the eloquence and passion of
the most genuine conviction:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Our Trimmer adores the Goddess Truth, though in all ages
she has been scurvily used, as well as those that worshipped her.
&#8217;Tis of late become such a ruining virtue that mankind seems to
be agreed to commend and avoid it; yet the want of practice,
which repeals the other laws, has no influence upon the law of
truth, because it has root in heaven, and an intrinsic value in
itself that can never be impaired. She shows her greatness in
this, that her enemies, even when they are successful, are ashamed
to own it. Nothing but power full of truth has the prerogative
of triumphing, not only after victories, but in spite of them, and
to put conquest herself out of countenance. She may be kept
under and suppressed, but her dignity still remains with her,
even when she is in chains. Falsehood with all her impudence
has not enough to speak ill of her before her face. Such majesty
she carries about her that her most prosperous enemies are fain
to whisper their treason, all the power upon the earth can never
extinguish her. She has lived in all ages, and let the mistaken
zeal of prevailing authority christen any opposition to her with
what name they please, she makes it not only an ugly and an
unmannerly, but a dangerous thing to persist. She has lived
very retired indeed, nay, sometimes so buried that only some few
of the discerning part of mankind could have a glimpse of her;
with all that, she has eternity in her, she knows not how to die,
and from the darkest clouds that shade and cover her she breaks
from time to time with triumph for her friends, and terror to her
enemies.</p>

<p>&#8216;Our Trimmer, therefore, inspired by this divine virtue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
thinks fit to conclude with these assertions, That our climate is
a trimmer between that part of the world where men are roasted
and that part where they are frozen: That our Church is a
trimmer between the phrenzy of phanatic<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> visions and the
lethargic ignorance of Popish dreams: That our laws are trimmers
between the excess of unbounded power and the extravagance
of liberty not enough restrained: That true virtue has
ever been thought a trimmer, and to have its dwelling in the
middle between the two extremes: That even God Almighty
himself is divided between his two great attributes, his mercy
and his justice.</p>

<p>&#8216;In such company our Trimmer is not ashamed of his name,
and willingly leaves to the bold champions of either extreme the
honour of contending with no less adversaries than nature, religion,
liberty, prudence, humanity, and common sense.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Burnet might well be puzzled by a man who &#8216;seemed to
have his head full of Commonwealth notions,&#8217; and yet
concurred in the worst measures of Charles II.</p>

<p>The most important of Halifax&#8217;s other essays are his
advice to his daughter, excellent for sense and curious as
an illustration of the manners of the age, and his character
of Charles II., nicely balanced between half-sincere censure
and half-sarcastic apology. There is nothing in Charles&#8217;s
history to refute Halifax&#8217;s view of him as a man whose
master passion was the selfish love of ease; but much to
prove that his abilities and discernment were far greater
than Halifax chooses to allow. Halifax&#8217;s aphorisms,
as usual, are too numerous to attain a uniformly high
standard, but some are exceedingly good.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;A fool hath no dialogue within himself.</p>

<p>&#8216;Malice may be sometimes out of breath, Envy never. A
man may make peace with hatred, but never with envy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8216;An old man concludeth from his knowing mankind that they
know him too, and that maketh him very wary.</p>

<p>&#8216;He that leaveth nothing to chance will do few things ill, but
he will do very few things.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>An allusion in these aphorisms to the Bank of England
proves that Halifax went on writing till nearly the hour
of his death in 1695. Of his other writings, the most
remarkable is the <i>Advice to a Dissenter</i> (1687), a masterly
dissuasive against abetting the illegalities of James.</p>

<p>Possibly, when Halifax penned the last-quoted aphorism,
he was thinking of Sir William Temple, well known to him
at the council-board, of whom Macaulay says, &#8216;It was his
constitution to dread failure more than he desired success.&#8217;
This elegant writer, whom we have already met as an
historian and as a speculator upon government, for once
did a rash thing when he entered into the controversy
respecting the comparative merits of the ancient and
modern writers, knowing little of either. Macaulay has
done full justice to the ignorance and carelessness of this
well-worded composition; but Macaulay has said nothing
of its extraordinary want of insight. Temple need not be
blamed for having been unable to make up his mind
whether the blood circulated, and whether the earth went
round the sun (the Grand Duke Cosmo found Cambridge
disputing against the latter proposition in 1669); what
is really astonishing is that he should have been utterly
blind to the stupendous consequences which Giordano
Bruno had pointed out a century before. &#8216;If they are
true,&#8217; he says, &#8216;yet these two great discoveries have made
no change in the conclusions of astronomy, nor in the
practice of physic, and so have been of little use to the
world, though perhaps of much honour to the authors.&#8217;
After this, Temple&#8217;s essays are not likely to be referred to
in quest of intellectual wisdom, and their chief value, apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
from the purity and elegance of their style, consists in
their illustrations of contemporary opinions and practices.
This is especially the case with the essay on <i>Health and
Long Life</i>. Temple enumerates with suppressed amusement
the various sanatory fads he has known, among
which he seems to reckon tea and coffee. Unconsciously
confirming an anecdote of Charles II. and his physicians,
related by Evelyn, he tells us that Peruvian bark was at
first received with prejudice and suspicion, but was becoming
rehabilitated in his day, and fairly confounds us
by his faith in &#8216;that little insect called millepedes; the
powder whereof, made up into little balls with fresh butter,
I never knew fail of curing any sore throat.&#8217;</p>

<p>The letter-writers of the age who have any claim to a
place in literature as such are but few, and none of their
epistles were intended for publication. Dryden, as elsewhere,
takes the lead, and his letters, though scanty and
occasional, occupy a pleasant chamber in the edifice of his
prose writings. The first, dated 1655, and addressed to a
female cousin in language of complimentary gallantry, is
of especial interest as showing how early his prose style
was formed. Notwithstanding the strain of high-flown
sentiment enforced by the occasion, it is far less fanciful
and involved than similar compositions of the early Caroline
period, and is in all essential respects an example of
the sound, clear prose of the Restoration. The letters to
the two Rochesters, the man of letters and the man of
office, are models of ingenious flattery in different styles;
those to his publisher, Jacob Tonson, apart from their
personal interest, are important for the light they throw
upon the relations between publishers and authors at a
period when publishers were as yet mere tradesmen, and
the most popular author could hardly subsist by authorship.
The latest of all, addressed to his Northamptonshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
kindred, are mellow as with the light of a setting sun, and
afford pleasant glimpses of the occasional ruralizings of
the most urban of poets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lady Temple&#8217;s
letters
(1652-1654).</div>

<p>Sir William Temple is so thoroughly identified with
the Restoration period, that although the
Lady Temple&#8217;s charming letters of his betrothed, Dorothy
Osborne, were written in 1652-54, and not
published until 1888, they may be regarded
as belonging to it. The young lady was well known from
Macaulay&#8217;s account of her in his essay upon her husband,
and many of her letters had been published in Courtenay&#8217;s
life of her husband, ere the whole, so far as preserved,
recently became accessible in the edition of Mr. Edward
Abbott Parry. Intended for no other eyes than her lover&#8217;s,
these letters have given Lady Temple high rank among
English epistolographers. Though they are exceedingly
well written, their charm is personal rather than literary.
No biographer or novelist has painted a truer picture of
the English maiden, high-minded and high spirited,
heroically constant and at the same time full of engaging
frailties and arch teasing ways, than is depicted in these
artless self-revelations. Temple seems to have behaved
perfectly well throughout their protracted engagement;
and his fulfilment of it after Dorothy&#8217;s beauty had been
destroyed by the smallpox may be reasonably believed to
have been the effect of inclination, no less than of honour
and duty. The very slight glimpse we obtain of their
married life reveals Lady Temple&#8217;s interest in his political
career; had this been guided by her his life would probably
have been less comfortable, and his memory more
glorious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dean Prideaux&#8217;s
letters
(1674-1710).</div>

<p>The letters of Humphrey Prideaux, Dean of Norwich,
to John Ellis, Secretary of the Treasury, edited for the
Camden Society by Sir Edward Maunde Thompson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
though ordinary familiar correspondence, are too curious
a repertory of
gossip to be passed over
without notice. They are mostly written
from Oxford, and retail the scandal of the
university in a lively fashion, although
the writer, a middling classical and oriental scholar, known
by his edition of the <i>Arundel Marbles</i> and his <i>Life of
Mahomet</i>, seems rather a matter-of-fact personage. His
relish for scandal, however, occasionally makes him
humorous, as when he describes the deportment of his
predecessor in the Norwich deanery: &#8216;His whole life is
the pot and the pipe, and, go to him when you will, you
will find him walking about his room with a pipe in his
mouth and a bottle of claret and a bottle of old strong
beer (which in this country they call nog) upon the table,
and every other turn he takes a glass of one or the other
of them.&#8217; The book is rich in such vignettes; its more
serious interest consists in its illustration of the practical
refutation of the theory of divine right previously held by
the majority of the clergy by James II.&#8217;s misgovernment.
The beginning and the end of the correspondence are in
violent political contrast; and the metamorphosis is entirely
effected during the last two years of James&#8217;s reign.</p>

<p>Literary history is necessarily among the latest developments
of literature. The nearest approach to it in the
England of the seventeenth century was the younger
Gerard Langbaine&#8217;s (1656-92) <i>Account of the English
Dramatic Poets</i>, Oxford, 1691. Langbaine laid himself
out particularly to discover the sources from which dramatists
had borrowed their plots, and is styled by Dr.
Johnson &#8216;the great detector of plagiarism.&#8217; He has been
accused of having read poetry for no other purpose, but is
vindicated by Mr. Sidney Lee. The value of his work is
much increased by the manuscript notes and additions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Oldys and others, copies of which are in the British
Museum and Bodleian. The literary compilations of
Edward Phillips are so poor that they would have deserved
no notice if he had not been Milton&#8217;s nephew, and
the first English author to mention <i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">ANTIQUARIANS AND MEN OF SCIENCE.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Anthony  Wood
(1632-1695).</div>

<p>The pursuit of antiquarianism has always flourished in
England since her inhabitants have enjoyed sufficient culture
to be aware that they possessed a past. Even the
poetry of Layamon is in a certain measure antiquarian,
and Chaucer, Spenser, Milton appear progressively more
and more leavened with antiquarian sentiment, which, as
a factor of literary inspiration, attains perhaps its highest
conceivable development in the works of Robert Burton
and Sir Thomas Browne. The Restoration period produced
no such examples of antiquarian men of genius; but
several excellent antiquarian writers, whose works are of
sufficient compass and intrinsic importance, and are distinguished
by sufficient attention to diction, to bring them
within the domain of literature. It may be said of all the
principal of these laborious men, that they have erected
imperishable monuments to themselves, and have left little
room for successors, except in the capacity of editors and
annotators. Of Anthony  Wood, the historian
and biographer of Oxford, it is almost
enough praise to say that two centuries have
elapsed without producing anyone capable either of continuing
his Oxonian labours on the same scale, or, since
the late Mr. C. H. Cooper&#8217;s work has remained incomplete,
of performing the like for the sister university. A terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
toiler, a loyalist and high churchman, as beseemed the
Oxonian of his day, but apparently with few serious interests
in life except the fame of his beloved Alma Mater,
he sat down at thirty in his college (Merton), and delved
resolutely until he had produced his <i>History and Antiquities</i>
(1674) and his <i>Athenae Oxonienses</i> (1691). The former
was originally published in a Latin version made by one
Peers, and seriously garbled at the instigation of Dr. Fell.
The original English text, however, was published in the
eighteenth century. The labours of Wood&#8217;s nineteenth
century editor, Dr. Bliss, upon the <i>Athenae</i>, are universally
known. Wood is not a pure or elegant writer, but his
works will last as long as Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rymer&#8217;s
<i>Foedera</i>.</div>

<p>Thomas Rymer has already been mentioned with due
disrespect among critics, and his more useful
and honourable labours as an antiquary do not,
strictly speaking, entitle him to be named
among men of letters, being mainly those of an editor.
It is impossible, however, to pass over in silence a collection
of such unspeakable value as his <i>Foedera</i>, ten folio
volumes of most precious documents relating to English
history from 1102 to 1654. Rymer the Dryasdust, however,
cannot quite forget Rymer the Longinus; his work
is graced with a Latin address to Queen Anne, more like
a dithyrambic than a dedication.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir William
Dugdale
(1605-1686).</div>

<div class="sidenote">Elias Ashmole
(1617-1692).</div>

<p>Next to Wood, the most important antiquary of the age
was Sir William Dugdale, of little account as
author, but whom his industry and the
assistance he was successful in enlisting from
various quarters, enabled to achieve several
works, any one of which would have sufficed to gain him
immortal renown as an antiquarian. These were his
monumental <i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i> (1655-1673), a gigantic
work, but founded in great part upon the collections of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Roger Dodsworth; his <i>Antiquities of Warwickshire</i> (1656),
an immense improvement upon everything that had previously
been effected in the department of county history,
and the model of all that has been accomplished since; his
<i>History of St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral</i> (1658), and his <i>Baronage of
England</i> (1675-1676). He was also the author of several
other works. So eminent a genealogist was naturally a
Cavalier, and, when he lost his appointment as Chester
herald during the Civil Wars, is said to have made his
living by the deaths of persons of quality, whose funerals
he conducted <i>secundum artem</i>. Private patrons and employers
helped him on until the Restoration, when, as successively
Norroy and Garter King-at-Arms, he attained
great prosperity, making numerous visitations, and approving
himself a terror to heraldic pretenders. He died at
eighty, of a fever contracted &#8216;by attendance too much on
his worldly concerns.&#8217; His son-in-law, Elias Ashmole,
was an eminent antiquary of a different
order, although his principal work, <i>Institution,
Laws, and Ceremonies of the Order of
the Garter</i>, might well have proceeded from Dugdale&#8217;s pen.
His turn, however, was rather for the collection of curiosities,
&#8216;the greatest virtuoso and curioso that ever was known
or read of in England before his time.&#8217; In this capacity
he collected the Ashmolean Museum, which has preserved
his name more effectually than anything he wrote or was
capable of writing. He was also an astrologer, the friend
of Lilly and Booker, and in his younger days an alchemist.
This latter pursuit was so far serviceable, that it led him to
preserve by printing twenty-nine rare old alchemical books.
After his history of the order of the Garter, his principal
work is his diary, which briefly but amusingly records the
vicissitudes of his generally prosperous life; his gain of
estate and loss of quiet by his second marriage; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
acquaintance with old Mr. Backhouse, the Rosicrucian,
&#8216;who told me, in syllables, the true matter of the philosopher&#8217;s
stone;&#8217; his prosperity under Charles II. as Windsor
herald and holder of several other offices; his third
marriage, with the daughter of his friend Dugdale; above
all, his acquisition of the Tradescant antiquities, which
formed the nucleus of the Ashmolean Museum. This
and his collection of manuscripts were bequeathed to the
University of Oxford; the catalogue of the latter forms a
goodly volume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Aubrey
(1626-1697).</div>

<p>Of far less importance than Dugdale or Ashmole as an
antiquary, John Aubrey is better remembered
as an author. His strictly literary qualifications
are few; setting aside his collections for
local history, his writings consist of little else than detached
memoranda. Their merit lies partly in the interest
of their themes, but still more in their artless simplicity
and the transparent revelation of the amiable if not dignified
character of one who might have sat to Addison for
Will Wimble. Aubrey remarks concerning himself that
he might have succeeded in life if he had been a painter.
Of his artistic powers we cannot judge, but the simple,
cheerful, social temper that befits the itinerant landscape
painter was his beyond question. For all more serious
careers he was totally unfit. He had lost money and estate
before middle life, and spent the remainder of his days
with much more satisfaction to himself in visiting, or,
when pressed by pecuniary difficulties, &#8216;delitescing&#8217; at the
mansions of country friends, a welcome and innocent parasite.
The guiding spirit of his literary work is charmingly
expressed by himself: &#8216;Methinks it shows a kind of gratitude
and good nature to revive the memories and memorials
of the pious and charitable benefactors long since
dead and gone.&#8217; In the same spirit, after relating how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
had seen Venetia Digby&#8217;s bust &#8216;standing at a stall at the
Golden Crosse, a brasier&#8217;s shop,&#8217; he exclaims, &#8216;How these
curiosities would be quite forgot, did not such idle fellows
as I am put them down!&#8217; He has hence retrieved from
oblivion a number of highly curious and interesting particulars
about men of letters from Shakespeare downwards,
and a most entertaining collection of stories of apparitions,
warnings, prophecies, and similar matters. Much of the
charm consists in the credulity and simplicity of the
narrator, who is nevertheless by no means incapable of
just and penetrating reflections on occasion, as when he
says of Shakespeare: &#8216;His comedies will remain wit as
long as the English tongue is understood, for that he
handles <i>mores hominum</i>; now our present writers reflect
so much upon particular persons and coxcombeities, that
twenty years hence they will not be understood.&#8217; Though
exceedingly industrious as a collector, &#8216;my head,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;was always working, never idle, and even travelling
did glean some observations, some whereof to be
valued,&#8217; he lacked the patience or the ability to reduce
these observations into form, and they have been mostly
incorporated with the works of succeeding antiquaries.
He was born at Easton Pierse, in Wiltshire, in 1626,
and died at Oxford in 1697. He is entitled to much
credit for having brought to light the Druidical remains
at Avebury in his native county, unnoticed before his
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sprat&#8217;s <i>History
of the Royal
Society</i>.</div>

<p>Along with the works of the antiquarians may be
mentioned a book of great interest, and in its
way of great merit, the <i>History of the Royal
Society</i> by the convivial and facetious Dean
of Westminster and Bishop of Rochester,
Thomas Sprat (1636-1713), whom we have already met
as a bad poet on his own account, but as the efficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
coadjutor of Buckingham in the <i>Rehearsal</i>. Cautious,
pliant, and self-indulgent, he almost incurred infamy
and deprivation by his unworthy compliances under James
II.; but he retracted just in time, rallied to the new
order of things, and recovered credit through the sympathy
excited for him as the object of a most diabolical
plot in the manner of Oates and Bedloe.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Of his <i>History
of the Royal Society</i> Johnson says: &#8216;The <i>History of the
Royal Society</i> is now read, not with the wish to know what
they were then doing, but how their transactions are
exhibited by Sprat.&#8217; If this was true at the time, it is
true no more. Sprat&#8217;s name is no longer a magnet; and,
in truth, although his enthusiasm for scientific research is
highly honourable to him, his style exceedingly lively, and
many of his observations replete with good sense, his work
as a whole is discursive and ill-digested, and so little of a
history that it hardly ever gives a date. The writer himself
confesses that it is only the second of his three books
has any proper claim to the title of history. But it is
important on grounds of its own, which render it of more
real value than the more exact and pragmatical narratives
which have superseded it. The glow of youth is upon it.
It paints vividly the great scientific awakening which coincided
with the accession of Charles II. The mere list of
the experiments which the Royal Society had performed,
or proposed to perform, attests the devouring scientific
curiosity of the age, and shows at once the reaction of
men&#8217;s minds in the direction of the tangibly useful after a
long series of fruitless theological and political controver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>sies,
and how deep in the long run had been the influence
of the great man who had lost his life in performing an
experiment. At the same time there is a humorous side to
the picture: much of the curiosity of the time was idle, much
was founded on credulity. Many of the queries which Sprat
catalogues with such complacency would now be thought too
trivial to engage the attention of a learned society, and some
are not a little absurd. In the main, however, they are most
significant of the new spirit that had come into the world.
A counter spirit was necessarily called into being also.
Sprat combats the objections of churchmen by proving that
enthusiasts cannot be natural philosophers, and propitiates
wits like Butler by promising them new ideas for their
writings. His demonstration that the design of the society
was in no respect prejudicial to the Church of England
may raise a smile now, but was probably by no means
superfluous at the time. His remarks upon the utility of
experiments display the most vigorous common sense; he
would evidently have subscribed heartily to a modern
definition of a fool as &#8216;a man who never made an experiment
in his life.&#8217; &#8216;If,&#8217; he says of the opponents of experimental
philosophy, &#8216;they will persist in contemning all
experiments except those which bring with them immediate
gain and a present harvest, they may as well cavil at the
providence of God that he has not made all the seasons of
the year to be times of mowing, reaping, and vintage.&#8217;
He enumerates eleven classes of experiments actually instituted
by the Royal Society, comprising a very large
number of separate essays, one of which, it is to be
feared, may not have perfectly succeeded, &#8216;Of making a
deaf and dumb man to speak.&#8217; His observations upon the
prospects of human improvement, the advantages of transplantation
and immigration, the national gain from encouraging
inventors and projectors, are conceived in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
same bold and liberal spirit, contrasting forcibly with his
timid and time-serving politics. In his advocacy of the
claims of London to rank as the metropolis of science, and
his exhortations to the English gentry to turn the leisure
and opportunity afforded by a country life to account
for the study of nature, he becomes what he never
is when writing verse&mdash;something bordering upon a
poet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evelyn&#8217;s <i>Sylva</i>,
1664.</div>

<p>As has been remarked, the latter half of the seventeenth
century was in England pre-eminently a scientific age.
The ideas of Bacon were generally acted upon, and it was
universally recognized that the only safe path to physical
knowledge was through experiment. Newton and Hooke,
in natural philosophy; Mayow, in chemistry; Sydenham,
in medicine; Grew, in vegetable anatomy; Ray, in the
classification of plants and animals, carried the fame of
their country to greater heights than even Bacon&#8217;s &#8216;eagle-spirit&#8217;
could have soared to imagine. But these illustrious
men did little or nothing for literature, for such was
not their design. The art of blending scientific research
with elegant disquisition remained to be invented. Many
of their works were composed in Latin; none were intended
for a miscellaneous public. Science, in consequence, was
far from exerting that influence upon creed and conduct
which she exercises in our day, and an age of scientific
discovery till then unexampled passed away without enriching
literature by a single classic. Two books alone,
neither of which can strictly be termed scientific, but both
of which touch outlying provinces of natural history, added&mdash;one
very considerably&mdash;to the literary wealth of the age.
They are Evelyn&#8217;s <i>Sylva</i> and Walton&#8217;s <i>Complete Angler</i>&mdash;both
by authors of whom we have previously had occasion
to speak. If any reader of Evelyn&#8217;s <i>Diary</i> should feel
prejudiced by the carping criticisms of De Quincey, he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
be safely referred to his <i>Sylva</i> (originally published in
1664, much augmented in later editions).
The writer here displays himself in a character
most alien of all others to that of a time-server
or a prig, that of an English country gentleman.
His work is further inspired by a genuine love of nature,
whose formality is justified by the stateliness of the theme,
and tempered by the almost personal affection of the
author for the trees he has known from a boy, or himself
called into being. The scholar is everywhere apparent.
&#8216;I did not,&#8217; he says, &#8216;altogether compile this work for the
sake of our ordinary rustics, mere foresters and woodmen,
but for the benefit and diversion of gentlemen and persons
of quality, who often refresh themselves in the agreeable
toils of planting and gardening.&#8217; It may be that Evelyn
thought too much of the requisites of this class of readers,
but, had he limited himself to a mere technical manual, he
would not now be read. We do not know how his precepts
are rated by the foresters and landscape gardeners of the
present age; but even if he has not always shown the way,
he has powerfully stimulated the wish to become a miniature
creator by embellishing the countenance of Nature.
His prose, more elaborate here than in his <i>Diary</i>, entitles
him to rank among the refiners of the language.</p>

<p>The literature of England has this among other points in
common with ancient literature, that it reckons books on
fishing among its classics. Oppian, who sang of the sea
and its inhabitants to Caracalla, is far from the worst
among the Greek poets, and has in particular expressed the
successful angler&#8217;s exultation with a truth and terseness
which no successor will surpass:</p>

<p>Half a century later Nemesian gained equal fame among
the Latins by a poem on the same theme, which has
not come down to us. The piscatorial eclogues of
Sanazzaro are an ornament of Italian literature, and were
imitated by Milton in his <i>Lycidas</i>;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but the first and best
modern poem on the technicalities of angling (<i>The Secrets
of Angling</i>, by John Dennys, 1630) is English, and is one
of the most pleasing didactic poems in the language.
The subject was next to have been taken up by a better
known writer, Sir Henry Wotton, but his intended work
was never completed, and it remained for Izaak Walton,
whom we have already met as an ecclesiastical biographer,
to render it equally interesting to the professional fisherman
and charming to the lover of idyllic pastoral.</p>

<p>The first edition (1653) is wellnigh the most prized of all
rare old English books. It had four more editions in the
author&#8217;s lifetime, all with additions and amendments, and
it is needless to observe that it has retained its popularity
to our day as completely as <i>Paradise Lost</i> or <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress</i>. The technical details are no doubt sound, except
for the author&#8217;s defective acquaintance with fly-fishing;
but the preservative against time has not been the didactic
skill which others might rival or surpass, but the accompaniment
of natural description and song and pictures
of country life, conveyed in a style whose quaint simplicity,
at once transparent and formal, is a survival from the old
Elizabethan days, to which, with their pastorals and poetry,
he himself looks back with so much affection:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;Look, under the broad beech-tree, I sat down, when I was
last this way a-fishing, and the birds in the adjoining grove seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
to have a friendly contention with an echo, whose dead voice
seemed to live in a hollow tree, near to the brow of that primrose-hill;
there I sat viewing the silver streams glide silently
towards their centre, the tempestuous sea; yet sometimes
opposed by rugged roots and pebble-stones, which broke their
waves, and turned them into foam: and sometimes I beguiled
time by viewing the harmless lambs, some leaping securely in the
cool shade, whilst others sported themselves in the cheerful sun;
and saw others craving comfort from the swollen udders of their
bleating dams. As I sat there, these and other sights had so
fully possessed my soul with content, that I thought, as the poet
has happily exprest it,</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;I was for that time lifted above earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And possessed joys not promis&#8217;d in my birth.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As I left this place and entered into the next field, a second
pleasure entertained me; &#8217;twas a handsome milk-maid, that had
not yet attained so much age and wisdom as to load her mind
with any fears of many things that will never be, as too many men
too often do; but she cast away all care, and sung like a nightingale;
her voice was good, and the ditty fitted for it: &#8217;twas that
smooth song, which was made by Kit Marlow, now at least fifty
years ago: and the milk-maid&#8217;s mother sung an answer to it,
which was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in his younger days.</p>

<p>&#8216;They were old-fashioned poetry, but choicely good, I think
much better than the strong lines that are now in fashion in this
critical age.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Passages like these create for the middle-aged man the
joy and charm of Walton&#8217;s <i>Angler</i>, which the boy devours
as a manual of the piscatorial art. To the more advanced
reader the chief use of the fish is as a vehicle for the
pastoral; nevertheless, the great success of Walton&#8217;s treatise
is a proof that he was by no means inefficient from a
more utilitarian point of view. Londoners have usually
made good anglers, except, from want of opportunity, as
fly-fishermen. Here it has been necessary to supplement
Walton very largely; and indeed he himself confesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
to having relied for such information as he does afford
upon another angler. Elsewhere he approves himself
master of his profession, and no doubt had trained many a
pupil, perhaps made many a convert like the Venator who
puts himself so readily under his tuition. Everyone
knows the proem of his book, instinct with the freshness of
the bright May morning, the otter hunt, a holy war in the
eyes of the injured fisherman (O blissful days, when otters
were yet to be found in the Lea!), and the earnest rhetoric
of Auceps, Venator, and Piscator, contending for the pre-eminence
of their favourite sports. It is characteristic of
Walton&#8217;s simplicity and candour that he should have placed
the most beautiful passage of his book in the mouth of one
of his opponents.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8216;These I will pass by, but not those little nimble musicians of
the air, that warble forth their curious ditties, with which nature
hath furnished them to the shame of art.</p>

<p>&#8216;As first the lark, when she means to rejoice: to cheer herself
and those that hear her, she then quits the earth, and sings as she
ascends higher into the air, and having ended her heavenly
employment, grows then mute and sad to think she must descend
to the dull earth, which she would not touch but for necessity.</p>

<p>&#8216;How do the blackbird and thrassel with their melodious voices
bid welcome to the cheerful spring, and in their fixed months
warble forth such ditties as no art or instrument can reach
to?</p>

<p>&#8216;Nay, the smaller birds also do the like in their particular
seasons, as namely the leverock, the tit-lark, the little linnet,
and the honest robin, that loves mankind both alive and dead.</p>

<p>&#8216;But the nightingale, another of my airy creatures, breathes
such sweet loud music out of her little instrumental throat, that
it might make mankind to think miracles are not ceased. He
that at midnight, when the very labourer sleeps securely, should
hear, as I have very often, the clear airs, the sweet descants, the
natural rising and falling, the doubling and redoubling of her
voice, might well be lifted above earth, and say Lord, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
music hast thou provided for the saints in heaven, when thou
affordest bad men such music on earth!&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>It has been remarked that it was necessary to supplement
Walton&#8217;s imperfect knowledge of fly-fishing. This
task, a delicate one in his lifetime, was piously and successfully
performed by a scholar, Charles Cotton, of Beresford,
Derbyshire (1630-1687), whose appendix of dialogues
appeared in the fifth edition of Walton&#8217;s own treatise
(1676) with some graceful introductory lines from Izaak
himself, then in his eighty-third year. &#8216;I have been so
obedient to your desires,&#8217; he says, &#8216;as to endure all the
praises you have ventured to fix upon me.&#8217; Cotton, a
country gentleman of good family, whose fishing cottage
on the Dove stands to this day, obtained some reputation
as a man of letters by a translation of Scarron&#8217;s burlesque
poem, and other versions from the French. He was also
an authority upon cards, which possibly accounts for the
pecuniary embarrassments which clouded the latter part of
his life. His piscatorial teaching is no doubt quite sound;
but his book, although a lively dialogue, is no idyll like his
master&#8217;s, and would be forgotten but for its association
with the latter. The best passages are those depicting the
horror of the London visitor at the steepness of the Derbyshire
hills and the narrowness of the Derbyshire bridges.
&#8216;I would not ride over it for a thousand pounds, nor fall off
it for two; and yet I think I dare venture on foot, though
if you were not by to laugh at me, I should do it on
all four.&#8217;</p>

<span class="smaller">TRAVELLERS.</span></h2>

<p>Travel was well represented in the literature of the
period, as could hardly be otherwise in an age distinguished
by the awakening of a spirit of curiosity and intelligent
inquiry. The time for systematic scientific exploration
had not arrived; no Englishman devoted himself to
travel as a profession with the steadiness of the Italian
Della Valle, or described a foreign land with such thoroughness
as in the Indian monograph of the French jeweller,
Tavernier. But if no such monumental work was produced,
there was no lack of standard ones. The two which
have come nearest to attaining the rank of literary classics,
however, were not the production of men of high attainments,
but the work, or reputed work, of writers of imperfect
education, whose chief claim to attention was the surpassing
interest of their narratives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Robert Knox
(1640?-1720).</div>

<p>Robert Knox belongs to the especially interesting class
of travellers whose experience of foreign
countries has been gained in captivity. Driven
by a storm on to the coast of Ceylon in 1659,
he was made prisoner and carried into the interior, then
almost unknown to Europeans. Here he supported himself
for nearly twenty years by knitting caps and hawking
goods, resisting all inducements to enter the service of the
native sovereign, whose caprice and cruelty he dreaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
with good reason. At length he escaped to a Dutch settlement,
and returned safely to England, where he entered
the service of the East India Company. After several
more voyages to the East he retired, and died in good
circumstances in 1720. His letters to his cousin, Strype,
preserved in the University Library, Cambridge, show
him, it is said, &#8216;to have been a man of morose temper,
rough manners, and a woman-hater.&#8217; The &#8216;manuscripts of
my own life,&#8217; bequeathed by him to his nephew, Knox
Ward, have unfortunately gone astray. His account of
his captivity was published in 1681, with a preface by the
illustrious natural philosopher, Robert Hooke, who no
doubt gave Knox much literary assistance, but happily
abstained from tampering with the simplicity of his narrative.
As a classic of travel this ranks with the similar
works of Drury and Mariner, which also received literary
form from intelligent collaborators, and it may have served
in some measure as an example to Defoe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William Dampier
(1652-1715).</div>

<p>William Dampier fills a more important place than
Knox in the history of travel, his experiences
having been much more diversified,
and his works being of much greater
compass. Having gone in 1679 to the West Indies on a
commercial adventure, he was persuaded to join a buccaneering
expedition, many of the piratical incidents of
which, judiciously passed over in his own narrative, are
recorded in the manuscripts of his companions. It involved
him in a series of adventures which took him all
round the world, and from which he returned in 1691
with no other property than an &#8216;amiable savage, curiously
tattooed.&#8217; His voyage was published in 1697-99, and
obtained such success that the government, overlooking or
ill-informed of his piracies, employed him on a voyage of
discovery to Australia. He was subsequently engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
two privateering expeditions, in the first as commander, in
the second only as pilot. Alexander Selkirk was put on
shore on Juan Fernandez in the first of these, and taken
off in the second. Dampier&#8217;s temper seems to have disqualified
him for supreme authority, and he lost much of
the reputation which he had formerly acquired. He died
in 1715 in good circumstances, with a large amount of
prize-money still owing to him. As a traveller he takes
high rank from the interest of the occurrences he narrates,
the clearness and simplicity of his style, his powers of
description, and his practical knowledge. &#8216;His <i>Discourse
of the Winds</i>,&#8217; says Professor Laughton, &#8216;may even now
be regarded, so far as it goes, as a text-book of that branch
of physical geography.&#8217; His literary merit, however, partly
belongs to some unnamed coadjutor. &#8216;I have,&#8217; says Charles
Hatton, in the Hatton correspondence edited by Sir Edward
Thompson, &#8216;discoursed with Dampier. He is a blunt
fellow, but of better understanding than would be expected
from one of his education. He is a very good
navigator, kept his journal exactly, and set down every
day what he thought of, but, you must imagine, had
assistance in dressing up his history, in which are many
mistakes in naming of places.&#8217;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burnet and
Molesworth.</div>

<p>The times were not ripe for archological exploration, or
for profound investigation of the manners and institutions
of foreign nations; and the most gifted travellers of the
age wrote with one eye upon things abroad and the other
upon affairs at home. Among such itinerant politicians
the first place must be given to Burnet,
rather, however, for his celebrity in other
fields than for the special merit of his travels.
He recorded, nevertheless, a number of intelligent observations
upon Switzerland, Italy, and Germany. Burnet is
always lively and sagacious, and much more impartial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
than could have been expected in one so deeply concerned
in political and theological controversies. His account of
Venice is especially interesting. The book, written during
his exile, was published in Holland, and was for some time
prohibited in England. The somewhat similar work of
Lord Molesworth (1656-1725) owes its existence to accident.
Molesworth, a theoretical republican of Algernon
Sidney&#8217;s school, was English envoy at Copenhagen from
1690 to 1692, and was obliged to quit the country in consequence,
as was asserted, of an insult offered by him to
the king; considering, however, the favourable character
he gives of the monarch, this appears hardly probable.
Whatever the reason, he threw up his embassy, and
avenged himself by a severe indictment of the system of
absolute government established in Denmark by the
memorable revolution of 1660, which he declared to have
entirely impoverished the country. Himself a patrician,
he finds the principal cause of this in the abasement of his
own class; and he probably wrote rather from regard to the
affairs of England than those of Denmark. He is a forcible,
but, at the same time, a candid writer, admitting frankly
that &#8216;In Denmark there are no seditions, mutinies, or
libels against the government; but all the people either are,
or appear to be lovers of their king, notwithstanding their
ill treatment, and the hardships they groan under. There
are no clippers or coiners, no robbers upon the highway,
nor housebreakers; which conveniency of arbitrary government,
among the multitude of mischiefs attending it, I
have likewise observed in France.&#8217; He is greatly impressed
with the merits of the Danish laws, apart from their
administration. &#8216;For justice, brevity, and perspicuity,
they exceed all that I know in the world. They are
grounded upon equity, and are all contained in one quarto
volume, written in the language of the country.&#8217; Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
passages are conclusive as to his impartiality, and the
violent attacks which his book provoked were probably
mainly due to its exceedingly plain speaking about individuals.
Of the Danes in general he says: &#8216;I never knew
any country where the minds of the people were more of
one calibre and pitch than here; you shall meet with none
of extraordinary parts or qualifications, or excellent in
particular studies and trades; you see no enthusiasts, madmen,
natural fools, or fanciful folks; but a certain equality
of understanding reigns among them. Every one keeps
the ordinary beaten road of sense, which in this country is
neither the fairest nor the foulest, without deviating to the
right or left.&#8217; Molesworth was a man of parts and independent
character, who afterwards rendered his country considerable
services in Ireland, where Swift dedicated one of
the Drapier&#8217;s letters to him as a patriot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paul Rycaut.</div>

<p>Paul Rycaut, secretary to the English ambassador at
Constantinople, and author of an exceedingly
valuable account of <i>The Present State of the
Ottoman Empire</i> (1668), should perhaps
hardly be reckoned among travellers, as he gives no account
of his residence, and merely condenses the results of
his observation of Ottoman manners and polity. The book
must have been highly important at a time when the Ottoman
still menaced Europe, and may be read with pleasure
even now for its good sense and varied information, which
includes a lively description of a palace revolution, and
an account of the chief religious sects among the Turks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward
Browne.</div>

<p>Doctor Edward Browne, son of Sir Thomas Browne, was
a highly accomplished man, whose travels in
Eastern Europe (1673) contain a remarkable
amount of accurate observation within a surprisingly
narrow compass. It seems strange to find him
foretelling a great territorial expansion of the Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
empire at the expense of Christian Europe, but the
prophecy came near being fulfilled by the peril of Vienna
not long after Browne wrote.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign
Travellers in
England.</div>

<p>This review of English travellers would not be complete
without a brief notice of two foreign visitors
to the country, whose narratives, translated
into English, have probably been more read
here than at home, and from whom much valuable
information may be derived. Sorbire, a philosopher
of Gassendi&#8217;s school, a Protestant by birth, but who
had become a nominal Catholic, visited England in 1663.
Being, as he admits, entirely ignorant of the language,
his attention was principally given to the intellectual
aspects of the country, which were not unfamiliar to him,
from his acquaintance with the works of Englishmen
who had written in Latin. His accounts of Oxford and
the Royal Society are neither unamusing nor uninstructive;
he has a true veneration for English men of science,
especially Bacon, whom he pronounces &#8216;the greatest man
for the interest of natural philosophy that ever was.&#8217; Of
English letters he can only say that &#8216;he understands that
all English eloquence consists in mere pedantry.&#8217; Writing
in the character of a courtier, Sorbire expresses himself
antagonistically to the English constitution, but it is difficult
to believe that his remarks are not sometimes ironical.
He can hardly have thought it a very extravagant idea on
the part of the commons &#8216;that their king ought to apply
himself entirely to maintain the public peace, to promote
the happiness of his people, and to advance the honour
and reputation of his country abroad, as much as possibly
he can.&#8217; We are nevertheless informed that this and
similar views arise from &#8216;a particular inclination they have
by nature to supply themselves with such disrespectful
arguments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>&#8217;</p>

<p>The travels in England of Duke Cosmo de&#8217; Medici, heir-apparent
to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, were performed
in 1669, and described by Signor Magalotti, a member of
his suite, whose manuscript account was translated into
English, and published in 1821. They are more interesting
than most foreign narratives of English travel, in so far
as Cosmo, having landed at Plymouth and travelled up to
London, and having afterwards made excursions to Oxford,
Cambridge, and other places, saw more of English country
life than usual, and inasmuch as they are accompanied by
excellent sketches taken by artists in his suite. It is most
delightful to be thus enabled to see towns and villages and
country-houses exactly as they appeared in the days of
Charles II., and it is only to be regretted that the artists
did not exercise their pencils upon the streets of London.
Magalotti is an intelligent and inquisitive traveller; but,
voyaging in the train of a prince, and unacquainted with
the language, he can tell us little respecting the people.
His account of what fell within his sphere is sensible and
impartial, with a few errors, such as the strange assertion
that Clarendon had been secretly a Presbyterian! He is
too much of a courtier to inform us respecting the court of
Charles II., except in the enumeration of titled persons
and officials, in which he is very exact. He gives a fair
account of the Royal Society, and of the theatre; but
seems unconscious of the existence of English literature
outside the walls of the playhouse.</p>

<p class="gap4">We have now accompanied the literature of the Restoration
period from its apparently sudden manifestation contemporaneously
with the return of the exiled monarch to
its transition into what is so appropriately in one point of
view, so unaptly in another, termed England&#8217;s Augustan age.
We have seen that this apparent abruptness was deceptive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
arising from the interruption of English literary development
by the Civil War and its consequences; and that the
Restoration literature represented tendencies which must
inevitably have prevailed without the infusion of any
French element. The old Elizabethan mode had become
inadequate to the vastly extended needs of the time, and
we are now able to recognize the literature of the Restoration
in its proper connection as a transition to
the thoroughly practical and business-like style of the
eighteenth century, which, having worked itself out in its
turn, and arrived at an impracticable position through the
total negation of imagination by its most characteristic
representatives,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> brought about the revival of the Elizabethan
spirit in the imaginative, spiritual, and at the same
time intensely human literature of the nineteenth century.
This in turn seems threatened with decay from the
exaggeration of its characteristic qualities; and the
antidote might be sought in less hopeful quarters than in
the sound sense, manly vigour, and solid execution of the
robust if prosaic writers of the Age of Dryden.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
